BACKGROUND: Risk of ovarian cancer in women with
frequent perineal talcum powder product is not well un-
derstood. Prior systematic reviews focused on ever use.
The purpose of this study is to estimate the association
between frequent (at least 2 times per week) perineal tal-
cum powder use and ovarian cancer.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was
conducted according to meta-analysis of observational
studies in epidemiology guidelines. Study protocol was
prospectively registered at PROSPERO (registration num-
ber CRD42020172720). Searches were performed in
PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials databases from their incep-
tion to August 2, 2021. Case-control and cohort studies
were included if they reported frequent perineal talcum
powder use and an adjusted odds ratio or hazard ratio for
ovarian cancer. Review for inclusion, data extraction, and
quality assessment (using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale
[NOS]) were performed independently by two reviewers.
Pooled adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals
were generated from the random effects model. Heteroge-
neity was quantified with I2 statistic. Funnel plot and
Eger’s test were performed to assess publication bias.
Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed for
testing the robustness of the overall findings.
RESULTS: Initial database searches returned 761
unique citations and after review, eleven studies describ-
ing 66,876 patients, and 6542 cancers were included
(Cohen’s κ = 0.88). Publication quality was high (median
NOS = 8, range: 4 to 9). Frequent talcum powder use was
associated with an elevated risk of ovarian cancer (adjust-
ed pooled summary odds ratio 1.47 (95% CI 1.31, 1.65,
P<0.0001). There was no evidence of bias and low hetero-
geneity (I2= 24%, P=0.22). There was no meaningful dif-
ference limiting analysis to publications with a NOS qual-
ity score of 8 or 9 or limiting studies based on study
design.
CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests an increased risk of
ovarian cancer associated with frequent perineal powder
exposure of 31–65%.

INTRODUCTION

Talc, the primary ingredient in baby powder, is a naturally
occurring mineral known for its softness and absorbency and
has been added to a broad range of personal care products
since the early part of the twentieth century. To date, there
have been seven systematic reviews and pooled data studies1–7
of the relationship between talcum powder products and ovar-
ian cancer. All studies including retrospective case-control
studies have found a positive association.2–7 The most recent
review by O’Brien1 limited analysis to the four prospective
cohort studies and in its main conclusion stated there was no
statistically significant association between genital talc use
and ovarian cancer.

The differences in conclusions between the metanalyses are
at least partially due to the inconsistent talcum-based powder
exposure questions regarding the frequency and type of expo-
sure. To harmonize the exposure measurements across the
greatest number of studies, prior meta-analyses primarily fo-
cused on quantifying the association between ever versus
never use of talcum powder products and ovarian cancer.
However, ever use is a non-specific exposure that could dilute
or obscure a meaningful association as ever use would com-
bine women with low and high exposures to talcum powder.
Knowledge of ovarian cancer risks are important for wom-
en’s health and important to guide regulatory oversight. The
purpose of this analysis is to estimate the risk of ovarian cancer
associated with the frequent use of talcum powder products.
We hypothesize that assessment of ovarian cancer risk among
frequent users of talcum powder products would provide a
more meaningful assessment of its carcinogenicity.

METHODS

We conducted a systematic review of the literature and meta-
analysis to assess the association between the frequent perineal
exposure to talc and ovarian cancer following the Meta-
analyses of Observational studies (MOOSE) reporting guide-
lines. A study protocol was developed in advance and regis-
tered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic
Reviews (PROSPERO) on April 28, 2020 (registration num-
ber: CRD42020172720).

Search Strategy and Information Sources

Comprehensive searches were performed by an expert health
science informationist from inception of the relevant databases
to August 2, 2021. Searches were completed in the following:
PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials. Each search consisted of talcum
powder and ovarian cancer concept blocks, which can be
viewed in the supplemental material. No date, language, or
other restrictions were incorporated into the searches. Dupli-
cate citations were removed in Endnote X9.3.1 (Clarivate
Analytic

Chunk 3

s). The references of all publications were searched
to identify additional publications.

Eligibility Criteria and Study Selection

Selection of studies included observational cohort and case-
control study designs. Studies were included if they reported
primary data on frequent, defined as multiple (2 or more) times
per week perineal exposure to talc, and reported an adjusted
odds ratio or hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) for
ovarian malignancy. Other uses of talcum powder, including
applications to the body, were excluded to isolate exposure
mechanism to perineal application. Conference abstracts,
retracted manuscripts, narrative reviews, editorials, case
reports, and manuscripts not reporting the location or frequen-
cy of talcum powder application were excluded.

Studies were screened for inclusion using prespecified se-
lection criteria by a single author (SW). Selection criteria
included publication of primary data, reporting on multiple
times per week (≥ 2 times per week) perineal exposure to
talcum powder including direct application of talcum powder
to the perineum and rectum, application to underwear or
sanitary napkins, or on birth control devices like diaphragms
and risk for ovarian malignancy. Studies were also selected for
baseline quality requiring a multivariable risk adjustment,
study size (n>10 cancers), and defined research methods to
allow assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria (flow
diagram Fig. 1). The search resulted in 761 citations, which
were screened at the title and abstract level by a single author
(SW). The full manuscripts of relevant citations (n=52) were
independently reviewed by two authors (SW and RSB).
Agreement for inclusion was calculated using the Cohen k
with the following scale: 0.01 to 0.20 indicates slight; 0.21 to
0.40, fair; 0.41 to 0.60, moderate; 0.61 to 0.8, substantial; and

0.81 to 0.99, almost perfect. Disagreements were resolved by
discussions.

The four prospective cohort studies as reported in
O’Brien1 did not meet the pre-specified definition for
frequent exposure. However, the questionnaires for two
of the included cohorts had asked women about more
frequent talcum powder use. As is standard in systematic
reviews to include relevant but unpublished results, we
contacted O’Brien and requested primary data from the
Nurses’ Health Study 1 (NHS1) and the Sisters Study
(SIS) for the highest frequency talc exposure group. The
data from NHS 1 were provided and described in the
Supplemental Table 1 and are included in the systematic
review. The data from the SIS study were not provided to
us due to the small sample size of exposed individuals in
the highest exposure category (n=2 women).

Data Extraction

Data extraction was performed by two authors (SW and RSB).
Extracted information included age range, enrollment period,
definition of frequency of talc use, size of control group or
cohort size, number of ovarian cancers, and adjusted hazard
ratio and odds ratio with 95% CI. D

Chunk 4

ata were included from the
highest reported talc use category to obtain as close to daily
use as possible and the referent group were women who
reported no talc exposure. When duplicate reports of the same
subjects were published, the publication reporting the highest
talc use was selected. The senior author was contacted to
obtain data for studies that reported frequent perineal talcum
powder exposure but did not publish the results on this expo-
sure. Disagreements in data extraction were resolved by
consensus.

Assessment of Risk of Bias and Study Quality

Eleven articles met selection criteria. The articles were inde-
pendently reviewed by two authors (SW and RSB) for quality
using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) where a score of 0–3
reflects a very high risk of bias, 4–6 reflects a high risk of bias,
and 7–9 reflects a high-quality study with low risk of bias. The
scale assesses the criteria used to select study groups, the
comparability of study groups, and ascertainment exposure
or outcome of interest. Results of the validity assessment were
discussed until agreement was reached (Table 1).

Data Synthesis

Individual study results were combined using summary esti-
mates generated from the random effects model8 and dis-
played with forest plots. Adjusted odds ratios and the adjusted
hazard ratio were combined given the infrequency of ovarian
cancer.9 As a sensitivity analysis, we removed the one cohort
study from the analysis and a study that combined non-
perineal talcum powder users with perineal talcum powder
users.

Heterogeneity was evaluated by inspecting funnel plots,
and by calculating the I2 values. Publication bias was evalu-
ated by visual inspection of the funnel plot and statistically
with Egger’s test. The NOS score was calculated for each
study and median, maximum, and minimum scores were
calculated across all included studies. As sensitivity analyses,
we repeated the meta-analysis first excluding the study with
the NOS score of 4, and then repeated the analysis limited to
studies with an NOS score of 8 or 9. SAS v. 9.4 was used, and
two-sidedP-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.

RESULTS

Initial database searches returned 761 unique citations
(Fig. 1). After title and abstract review, 52 potential
citations remained. After full-text review, 11 publica-
tions met
the inclusion criteria including a total of
6542 ovarian cancer cases and 66,876 women
(Table 2).1,10–19 The interrater agreement in determining
the final study cohort from the 52 full-text reviews was
excellent (Cohen’s k=0.88). The included studies include
10 retrospective case-control studies and a single cohort

significant publication bias (Egger's test, P=0.94) (Fig 3). When
limited to the case-control studies, the summary pooled odds
ratio was 1.49 (P<0.0001, 95% CI 1.29, 1.72) (Supplementary
Figures 1 and 2), whereas the odds ratio for the cohort study was
1.40 (95% CI 1.17, 1.68). When excluding Wu et al.19 which
combined perineal administration of talcum powder with other
methods, the summary pooled odds ratio was 1.44 (95% CI
1.29, 1.60) (Supplementary Figure 3) and the studies remained
homogenous (I2= 6.5%, P=0.382) without publication bias

homogenous (I2=39.3%, P=0.12) and did not have publication
bias (Egger’s test, P=0.97) (Supplementary Figure 8).

DISCUSSION

We found frequent use of perineal talcum powder is associated
with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, with a pooled adjusted
odds ratio of 1.47 (95% CI 1.31, 1.65). The 11 contributing
studies included in the review, including the longest published
follow-up available from the Nurses’ Health Study cohort, were
homogenous, and the summary estimate was robust in the sensi-
tivity analysis. This meta-analysis makes a significant contribu-
tion to the available evidence as it is the first study that summa-
rizes the published cohort and case-control literature that focuses
on frequent (multiple times per week) rather than ever use of talc.
The precise mechanism whereby talcum powder causes
ovarian cancer is not fully understood. It is widely speculated
that trans-genital migration of talc powder through the fallo-
pian tubes to the ovaries and peritoneum results in inflamma-
tion and a cascade of changes that result in carcinogenesis.20,21
Talc fibers are found within normal ovaries and within ovarian
cancer with “cosmetic” talc use22,23 supporting this theory. A
case series by Steffen et al. reported 10 cases of patients with
“cosmetic” talc exposure and serous ovarian cancer evaluated
the surgical specimens as well as cosmetic talcum powder

manufactured in the 1950s. The transmission electron micro-
scope tissue analysis and phase contrast microscopy found talc
in every serous ovarian cancer and anthophyllite asbestos in
80% (8/10) of the serous ovarian cancers, which matched the
talcum-based powder from the 1950s. Asbestiform talc is
considered, along with asbestos, as a class 1 carcinogen for
ovarian cancer, by the International Agency for Research on
Cancer.24 Thus, the strongest and most widely believed theory
is that asbestiform talc fibers and asbestos fibers are the
etiological agents leading to the elevated cancer risk associated
with their use.

The pooled odds ratio of 1.47 is higher than that of six
additional systematic reviews which included case-control
studies, all of which also report a statistically significant
association between talc and ovarian cancer (range of adjusted
odds ratios: 1.24–1.35).2–7 O’Brien et al.1 concluded that
perineal talcum powder exposure in cohort studies was not
significantly associated with ovarian cancer. However, when
O’Brien limited to women with patent fallopian tubes the
hazard was 1.13 (95% CI: 1.01 to 1.26) for ever versus never
use and there was a dose response with increasing risk with
increasing frequency of talcum powder use with a hazard ratio


Chunk 8

of 1.40 (95% CI: 1.17 to 1.68) for daily users. The magnitude
of the higher association in our study compared to prior case-
control and cohort meta-analyses was likely due to our focus
on frequent rather than any talcum powder users, inclusion of
quality studies, and consistent definition of the exposure.

Our meta-analysis included both case-control and cohort
observational studies allowing use to include more cancer cases
than cohort alone. Although there is the general belief that
cohort studies are better than case-control studies, both can
provide accurate and meaningful information about statistical

associations. Since most publications on talc used a case-control
design with detailed quantification of the type and frequency of
talc exposure missing from most of the cohort studies, it is
important to include the data from the case-control studies in
any summary estimate of the association with ovarian cancer.
While cohort studies can provide a superior design for some
research questions, the method provides less useful results when
quantification of the exposure is too crude to provide a mean-
ingful estimation of exposure. Cohort studies for talcum powder
did not define the type of powder exposure, consistently define
frequency and duration, capture changes in exposure over time,
and relied on recall by participants for exposure which may
involve misclassification as would be expected in case control
studies.25–27 Although it is well known that case-control study
design is susceptible to recall bias and misclassification, the bias
was likely limited to participant recollection of their exposure
rather than influenced by the media, given there was no public-
ity on the topic at the time of most publications: the first legal
case was reported in the press in 2014 long after most studies
completed recruitment. The one study where patient recruitment
occurred after 2014 patients was Schildkraut et al.,17 where
recruitment occurred between 2010 and 1015, and they adjusted
for the additional bias.

Strengths and Limitations

The primary strength of our study is our focus on frequent
users of perineal talcum powder. Among women who report
talcum powder use, the most common frequency is daily
use,13 and this is the first systematic review to focus on
multiple times per week users. The results were highly con-
sistent and homogenous, and the included studies were of high
quality. The work has limitations as well. We constructed our

2532

selection criteria prospectively to include studies with multiple
times per week and as close to daily talcum powder exposure
as possible. However, this meant that cohort and case-control
studies that might have frequent-use patients were excluded if
the questionnaire did not explicitly capture this information.
The definition of talcum powder use varied by frequency and
duration between the case-control and cohort studies. Addi-
ti

Chunk 9

onally, studies by Cook et al.12, Mills et al.15, Rosenblatt
et al.16, and Schildkraut et al.17 were unable to differentiate
between use of perineal powders and the small subset using
cornstarch (estimated at 1.5%). However, the differences in
definition and small inclusion of cornstarch likely did not
affect the results as there was no evidence for statistical het-
erogeneity in our study. The included studies were adjusted for
multiple covariates. The possibility of additional confounders
to the studies likely exists.

Conclusions and Implications

In this analysis of pooled data from 10 case-control studies and
a single cohort study, the frequent use of perineal talcum
powder use is associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer.
These results support women avoiding the frequent use of
talcum powder in the perineal area.

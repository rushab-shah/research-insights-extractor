The\\n\\n aetiology of the disease is not well understood, except\\n\\n that inherited mutations in the breast cancer genes BRCA-\\n\\n 1 and BRCA-2 account for up to 10% of all cases,1 and\\n\\n child-bearing, oral contraceptive use and breast-feeding\\n\\n reduce the risk.2 Some environmental exposures, notably\\n\\n talc and asbestos, have been suspected as ovarian\\n\\n carcinogens.\\n\\n Talc refers to both mineral talc and industrial\\n\\n null (10 studies), with odds ratios (ORs) ranging\\n from 1.0 to 3.9. None of the studies reported\\n relative risks below 1.0. The population-based case-\\n control studies,11 15\\\"17 20-26 28\\\"30 included studies with\\n 112-824 ovarian cancer cases, and had odds ratios\\n ranging from 1.1 to 3.9 (fig 1). The hospital-based\\n case control studies12'14 18 19 27 included studies with\\n\\n 77-462 cases, and reported odds ratios between 1.0\\n and 2.5. Pooled odds ratios were calculated by fixed\\n effects model. As shown in figure 1 pooled ORs\\n were 1.40, 1.12 and 1.35 for population-based,\\n hospital-based and all case control studies com-\\n bined, respectively. Some studies13 14 22 23 26 28 tried\\n to assess exposure-response associations, in terms\\n of frequency of use or length of use in years but\\n found no clear trend.\\n\\n products that contain mineral talc. Mineral talc\\n occurs naturally in many regions of the world and\\n is valued for its softness, platyness, and ability to\\n absorb organic matter. Mineral talc occurs natu-\\n rally in a platy (flat) form, but may also occur as\\n asbestiform fibres, which describes its physical\\n form and does not imply the presence of asbestos.\\n The purer forms (approximately 90% mineral talc)\\n are used for cosmetic and hygiene products\\n including baby powders and feminine hygiene\\n products. Perineal use of cosmetic talc is a common\\n practice in the United Kingdom, North America,\\n Australia and some other countries. To our knowl-\\n\\n edge accurate estimates of prevalence of use of\\n cosmetic talc are not available. However, the use\\n for female hygiene of body powders, baby pow-\\n ders, talcum powders and deodorising powder,\\n most of which contain cosmetic talc in varying\\n amounts, has been reported to be as high as 50% in\\n some countries.3\\n\\n From pathological studies it is known that\\n particles and fibres that enter the body can migrate\\n to distant organs. For instance, asbestos fibres have\\n been found in ovaries from women exposed to\\n asbestos.4 5 Analogously, following perineal appli-\\n cation, talc particles can migrate from the vagina to\\n the peritoneal cavity ", "and ovaries.6 A majority of\\n women experience retrograde menstruation7; this\\n suggests a mechanism by which talc particles can\\n travel through the female reproductive tract to the\\n ovaries. Furthermore, epidemiological studies have\\n shown decreased risks of ovarian cancer after tubai\\n\\n ligation and/or hysterectomy, suggesting that\\n removing a pathway by which carcinogenic sub-\\n stances can reach the ovaries reduces the risk.8 9\\n\\n The association between talc use in the perineal\\n region and ovarian cancer was investigated in one\\n cohort study,10 and 20 case-control studies.11\\\"30 In\\n the cohort study, arguably the strongest study\\n because of its partly prospective ascertainment of\\n exposure, there was no association between\\n cosmetic talc use and risk of all subtypes of ovarian\\n cancer combined. The various case-control studies\\n\\n provided indications of either a significant excess\\n risk (10 studies) or non-significant excess risk or\\n\\n Methodological factors such as recall bias should\\n\\n always be considered in case-control studies. It\\n could have been a problem had there been wide-\\n spread publicity about the possible association\\n between use of body powder and cancer. The\\n International Agency for Research on Cancer\\n (IARC) working group considers that there has\\n not been widespread public concern about this\\n issue and therefore considers it unlikely that such a\\n bias could explain the consistent findings. Another\\n source of recall bias could result from the fact that\\n\\n women with the cancer tend to remember or over-\\n\\n report their use of body powder. The influence of\\n this type of recall bias cannot be ruled out.\\n\\n Eight of the population-based case-control stu-\\n diesii i6 22-24 26 28 29 were identified, by the IARC\\n working group as being most informative in terms\\n of size of the studies, whether the studies were\\n population-based, participation rates and adjust-\\n ments of confounding variables. The selected studies\\n included at least 188 cases and had participation\\n rates ranging from 60% to 75%. Among these eight\\n studies, the prevalence of perineal use of talc-based\\n body powder among controls ranged from 16% to\\n 52%. The relative risks of ovarian cancer among\\n body powder users were homogeneous across this\\n set of eight studies, each of which indicated a 30-\\n 60% increase in risk. Among the other 12 case-\\n control studies, most also reported relative risks of\\n this magnitude or higher.\\n\\n Information on talc use in infancy is generally\\n insufficient in the case-control studies. However, in\\n one study the exposure to baby powder was\\n reported by 42.2% of the cases and 40.5% of the\\n controls.15 In several of the other studies patients\\n were asked about age at first use of perineal talc, as\\n an indicator for use in infancy or other periods of life.\\n\\n Only four case-control studies16 23 29 30 and one\\n cohort study10 provided results by histological type.\\n In four of these studies, in particular the cohort\\n study, there were hints of higher risks of serous\\n tumours related to talc exposure.\\n\\n 358 J Epidemiol Community Health 2008;62:358-360. doi:10.1 136/jech.2006.047894\\n\\nThis content downloaded from \\n\\n(cid:0)73.197.218.202 on Fri, 09 Jun 2023 05:59:57 +00:00(cid:0)\\n\\n(cid:0) \\n\\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\\n\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n\f Research report\\n\\n Figure 1 Results from case-control studies contributing data on perineal talc use and ovarian cancer.

There was some\\n indication in the cohort study of an increase in serous tumours.\\n The evidence of talc migrating to the ovaries lends credibility to\\n such a possible association. The main epidemiological evidence\\n against the association is the absence of clear exposure-res", "ponse\\n associations in most studies, as well as the absence of an overall\\n\\n excess risk in the cohort study.\\n\\n On balance, the epidemiological evidence suggests that use of\\n cosmetic talc in the perineal area may be associated with\\n ovarian cancer risk. The mechanism of carcinogenicity may be\\n related to inflammation.32\\n\\n The carcinogenicity of non-asbestiform talc was assessed by a\\n monograph working group at IARC in 2006.33 After considering\\n biases and possible confounding factors, the IARC working\\n group concluded that the epidemiological studies provided\\n\\n limited evidence for the carcinogenicity of perineal use of talc-\\n based body powder, and classified this use as possibly\\n carcinogenic to human beings (that is, group 2B).34\\n\\n PROPOSAL: TO RESEARCH COMMUNITY\\n\\n The current body of experimental and epidemiological evidence\\n is insufficient to establish a causal association between perineal\\n use of talc and ovarian cancer risk. Experimental research is\\n needed to better characterise deposition, retention and clearance\\n of talc to evaluate the ovarian carcinogenicity of talc.\\n\\n The majority of the epidemiological studies carried out so far\\n have been among American women. It would be instructive to\\n seek evidence in other countries where perineal use of talc has\\n been common.\\n\\n While there has been some efforts to measure the degree of\\n\\n use, these have mainly been measured simply as the reported\\n years of use. It is possible that the ostensible lack of exposure\\n response trends is the result of crudeness of the exposure metric\\n used. Therefore, it is important that future studies, irrespective\\n of study design, devote some effort to better assessment of\\n exposure. The use of body powders should be assessed both in\\n terms of calendar time and age of the subject. Subjects should be\\n asked about lifetime use, including age at initial use (infancy,\\n childhood, teenager years, adulthood), age at which they\\n stopped using such powders, gaps in the lifetime period of use\\n\\n J Epidemiol Community Health 2008:62:358-360. doi:10.1 136/jech.2006.047894 359\\n\\nThis content downloaded from \\n\\n(cid:0)73.197.218.202 on Fri, 09 Jun 2023 05:59:57 +00:00(cid:0)\\n\\n(cid:0) \\n\\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\\n\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n(cid:0)\\n\f Research report\\n\\n 3.

YOUNG\\n\\n4\\n\\nPerineal talc use has been suggested as a possible risk\\nfactor for ovarian cancer based on its structural similarity to\\nasbestos, a known human carcinogen. A population-based\\nepidemiologic case-control study of epithelial ovarian cancer\\n(EOC) was conducted in 22 counties of Central California\\nthat comprise the reporting area for 2 regional cancer reg-\\nistries. Telephone interviews were conducted with 256 cases\\ndiagnosed in the years 2000 \u20132001 and 1,122 controls fre-\\nquency-matched on age and ethnicity. The interview ob-\\ntained information on demographic factors, menstrual and\\nreproductive experience, exogenous hormone use, surgical\\nhistory and family history of cancer. Questions on perineal\\ntalc use included frequency of use, duration of use and spe-\\nci\ufb01c years when talc was used. Multivariate-adjusted odds\\nratio (OR) and 95% con\ufb01dence intervals (CI) were derived\\nfrom unconditional logistic regression. The OR for ever use\\nof talc was 1.37 (CI (cid:1) 1.02\u20131.85) compared to never users.\\nHowever, no dose response association was found. Tubal\\nligation (TL) modi\ufb01ed the effect of talc on EOC such that\\nwomen with TL had an OR of 0.88 (CI (cid:1) 0.46 \u20131.68) associ-\\nated with perineal talc use, whereas women with no TL had\\nan OR of 1.54 (CI (cid:1) 1.10 \u20132.16). Talc use and EOC risk was\\nhighest in women with serous invasive tumors (OR (cid:1) 1.77;\\nCI (cid:1) 1.12\u20132.81). This study provides some support for the\\nhypothesis that perineal talc use is associated with an in-\\ncreased risk of EOC.\\n\u00a9 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\\n\\nKey words: epidemiology; gynecologic cancer; risk factors\\n\\nInterest in the relationship between talcum powder and ovarian\\ncancer risk is based on certain physical properties of talcum\\npowder, including the fact that talc is mineralogically similar to\\nasbestos and that talcum powder manufactured before 1973 may\\nhave been contaminated with asbestos.1 In animal studies, talc and\\nother similar substances have been demonstrated to migrate from\\nthe vagina through the peritoneal cavity to the ovaries.2 Henderson\\net al.3 also observed that particles with the appearance of talc were\\nmore prevalent in ovarian tumors than in normal ovarian tissue.\\nSeveral epidemiologic studies have investigated perineal use of\\ntalcum powder as a potential risk factor for ovarian cancer and\\nmost have found elevations in risk, although there has been a large\\nrange in the risk estimates, from 1.1 to 3.9.4 Collectively, these\\nstudies point to a possible etiologic role of talc in ovarian cancer\\nvia an in\ufb02ammatory process at the site of the ovarian epithelium,5\\nalthough recall bias may play a role in retrospective studies.4\\nIn\ufb02ammation produces oxidants that are thought to damage DNA\\nand Ames et al.6 argue that damage to tumor suppressor genes\\ncaused by the in\ufb02ammatory process leads to carcinogenesis.\\nChronic in\ufb02ammation may also result in deregulated cytokine\\nproduction, which may result in altered cell growth, inhibition of\\napoptosis and changes in differentiation.7\\n\\nCramer et al.8 proposed 2 mechanisms that might explain talc\\ncarcinogenesis. Talc may stimulate the entrapment of the ovarian\\nsurface epithelium, thus mimicking what occurs during ovulation\\nand posing a risk similar to that proposed by incessant ovulation.9\\nAlternatively, if talc is present at the time of ovulation, it may\\nbecome incorporated into the inclusion cyst. It has been suggested\\nthat foreign-body exposure may result in granulomas10 and that\\n\\npure talc may induce granulomas in open wounds.11 Granulomas\\nare also associated with persistent acute in\ufb02ammatory responses.12\\nThe role of cornstarch powder on ovarian cancer risk has also\\nbeen evaluated in epidemiologic research and a recent review\\nconcluded that there is no association between this type of powder\\nand increased risk of ovarian cancer.13 The conclusion was based\\non a total of 4 case-control studies that elicited information on use\\nof cornstarch in perineal dusting, in which the average odds ratio\\nwas 0.62. However, there were only a total of 20 cases of ovarian\\ncancer combined in those studies and 51 control subjects. Corn-\\nstarch is also not thought to exert the same toxicologic reaction in\\nhuman tissue as does talc.13\\n\\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\\n\\nA population-b", "ased epidemiologic case-control study of epithe-\\nlial ovarian cancer (EOC) was conducted in 22 counties of Central\\nCalifornia that comprise the reporting area for 2 regional cancer\\nregistries. Geographically, these counties make up the majority of\\nthe Central Valley of California, which is the poorest area of the\\nstate, with many residents living below the poverty level.14 De-\\nmographically, the Valley is a very ethnically diverse area in\\nwhich many counties are over 40% Hispanic. Two population-\\nbased cancer registries have monitored cancer incidence in the\\nCentral Valley of California continuously since 1988: the Cancer\\nRegistry of Central California (CRCC) in Fresno and the Cancer\\nSurveillance Program (CSP), Region 3, in Sacramento.15,16 All\\nnewly diagnosed histologically con\ufb01rmed EOC patients were\\navailable for inclusion in this study for the years 2000 and 2001.\\nCases were women-identi\ufb01ed via a rapid case ascertainment\\n(RCA) procedure as having been diagnosed with EOC (malignant\\nneoplasms of the ovary, ICD-O 3 (cid:1) C56.9) living in the Central\\nValley during a 24-month period from 1 January 2000 through 31\\nDecember 2001. Tumors were designated as borderline if the\\nbehavior code was designated as 1, or if the pathology report\\ndescribed the tumor as borderline, low malignant potential, or\\natypically proliferating.17 The borderline classi\ufb01cation was limited\\nto serous and mucinous cell types because ICD-O 3 has no mor-\\nphology code for the borderline classi\ufb01cation in the other subtypes\\nand because serous and mucinous tumors make up the majority of\\nborderline tumors.18 All other tumors were classi\ufb01ed as invasive.\\n\\nGrant sponsor: the California Cancer Research Program; Grant number:\\n\\n98-16022.\\n\\n*Correspondence to: Cancer Registry of Central California, 1320 E.\\n\\nShaw Avenue, Suite 160, Fresno, CA 93710.

The histologic subtypes included\\nwere serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell and other epithe-\\nlial/unclassi\ufb01ed. The latter category included unspeci\ufb01ed adeno-\\ncarcinomas as well as undifferentiated tumors in which a cell type\\ncould not be classi\ufb01ed histologically. All newly diagnosed EOCs\\nof epithelial origin were identi\ufb01ed via RCA methods in which\\nhospital tumor registrars were asked to provide listings of newly\\ndiagnosed EOCs within 1 month of diagnosis. A board-certi\ufb01ed\\npathologist reviewed the pathology reports of a sample of cases.\\nPhysician consent was obtained by mailing the physician of record\\na letter and informing him/her that an interview with the patient\\nwas planned. If the physician did not respond within a 3-week\\nperiod, passive consent was assumed. The control group consisted\\nof women 18 years or older selected by random digit dialing\\n(RDD) techniques who were residents of the area, had not been\\ndiagnosed with EOC and had at least one intact ovary at the time\\nof the interview. Controls were frequency matched to cases on age\\nand race/ethnicity. The overall data collection period covered a\\n2-year period, with each respondent being interviewed only once\\nduring this period by telephone. Interviews were conducted with\\nboth cases and controls on a monthly basis throughout the 2-year\\nperiod.\\n\\nAll cases and controls were approached via an introductory\\nletter that included a prompt list that described topics the interview\\nquestions would address. The Institutional Review Board at the\\nPublic Health Institute approved the study protocol. For both case\\nand control groups, letters and prompt lists were sent in either\\nEnglish or Spanish on the letterhead of the principal investigator.\\nTelephone interviews with both case and control respondents were\\nconducted by female professional, trained telephone interviewers\\nin either English or Spanish as preferred by the respondent.\\n\\nThe interview obtained information on demographic factors as\\nwell as information pertinent to the respondent\u2019s menstrual and\\nreproductive experience, use of exogenous hormones, gynecologic\\nsurgical history and family history of cancer. Four questions were\\nasked in regard to the use of talcum powder, including adult use in\\nthe genital area, calendar year(s) of use, frequency of use (i.e.,\\ndaily, several times a week) and total duration of use. The last 2\\nquestions were used to create a variable re\ufb02ecting\u2014 cumulative\\nuse by combining frequency (categorically weighted 0 \u20133) and\\nduration (in months) of use.\\n\\nAge-adjusted odds ratios were calculated using the Mantel-\\nHaenszel method.19 Multivariate adjusted odds ratios were calcu-\\nlated using unconditional logistic regression.20 Initially, multivar-\\niate models were construc", "ted to include age as a continuous\\nvariable and race/ethnicity, duration of use of oral contraceptives,\\nduration of breast-feeding, history of breast or EOC in a \ufb01rst-\\ndegree relative, pregnancy history, parity, body mass index (BMI),\\nhysterectomy, tubal ligation and duration of hormone replacement\\ntherapy use as categorical variables. However, the Hosmer-Lem-\\nshow goodness-of-\ufb01t tests revealed that after terms for duration of\\noral contraceptive use and duration of breast-feeding were added\\nto the models, \ufb01t was not improved by the addition of the other\\nvariables listed above. Nor were the estimated odds ratios altered\\nby the addition of the several variables listed above. Therefore, in\\nthe interest of parsimony, the \ufb01nal models chosen for the analysis\\nincluded terms for age, race/ethnicity, oral contraceptive use and\\nbreast-feeding. Interaction was assessed by comparing stratum-\\nspeci\ufb01c odds ratios. If the stratum-speci\ufb01c odds ratios differed by\\nmore than 100%, interaction was also assessed by including \ufb01rst-\\norder cross product terms into the logistic model and examining\\nthe signi\ufb01cance of the interaction coef\ufb01cient. Tests for trend were\\nconducted for variables that were ordinal in nature by recoding the\\ncategories into continuous form and evaluating the Wald statistic\\nassociated with the resulting coef\ufb01cient. Confounding was as-\\nsessed by examining the differences in the crude, age-adjusted and\\nmultivariate-adjusted odds ratios.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe regional cancer registries initially identi\ufb01ed a total of 652\\ncases of con\ufb01rmed epithelial ovarian cases residing in the 22\\ncounty study area diagnosed between 1 January 2000 and 31\\nDecember 2001. Seventeen cases were excluded due to speaking a\\nlanguage other than English or Spanish or due to hearing/speech\\nimpairment, resulting in 635 cases that met the study criteria.\\nSeventy-six cases died prior to research contact and physicians\\nrefused permission to contact for 10 cases. Forty-one cases were\\ntoo ill to participate in the study and 119 were not contacted due\\nto incorrect telephone numbers or no answer after repeated efforts.\\nOf the remaining 389 cases, 133 refused to participate, resulting in\\n256 completed interviews. Therefore, the response fraction was\\n40% among all cases identi\ufb01ed. There were no signi\ufb01cant differ-\\nences in age (p (cid:1) 0.273) or level of invasiveness between inter-\\nviewed and noninterviewed cases. Histologically,\\ninterviewed\\ncases were more likely to be of the serous subtype (57.4% for\\ninterviewed cases, 45.6% for noninterviewed cases) and less likely\\nto be classi\ufb01ed as \u201cother epithelial\u201d (10.5% for interviewed cases;\\n22% for noninterviewed cases). There was no statistically signif-\\nicant difference between interviewed and noninterviewed cases for\\nthe other histologic subtypes. Information on perineal talc use was\\nmissing in 7 cases.\\n\\nHouseholds with eligible women were identi\ufb01ed through RDD\\nmethods, resulting in 2,327 controls identi\ufb01ed and sent an intro-\\nductory letter with a prompt list. Eighty of these women were later\\nfound not to meet the age requirement and 21 were ineligible due\\nto residence outside the study area. Ten controls were excluded\\ndue to speaking a language other than English or Spanish. Two\\nhundred \ufb01fty-two controls were excluded due to reporting bilateral\\noophorectomy, resulting in 1,964 controls that met\\nthe study\\ncriteria. Nineteen controls were too ill to participate and 358 were\\nlater found to have moved, changed phone numbers, or failed to\\nanswer after repeated efforts. Of the remaining 1,587 contacted\\ncontrols, 465 refused to participate, resulting in 1,122 completed\\ncontrol interviews for a response fraction of 57% for total identi-\\n\ufb01ed eligible controls. Information on perineal talc exposure was\\nmissing in 17 controls.\\n\\nInvasive tumors constituted 71.1% of the case series and 28.9% of\\nthe tumors were of borderline malignancy. Among non-Hispanic\\nwhite women, who constituted 74% of the cases, 25.8% were of\\nborderline invasiveness. Overall, 57% of the case series were serous\\nadenocarcinomas, divided 60% and 40% for invasive and borderline,\\nrespectively. Mucinous and endometrioid each comprised 14% of the\\nEOC cases. There were slightly more mucinous borderline cases than\\ninvasive cases. Clear cell and other/unclassi\ufb01ed histologies made up\\nthe remaining 5% and 11%, respectively.\\n\\nThe demographic characteristics of all cases and controls and\\ncases and controls strati\ufb01ed by talc exposure are shown in Table I.\\nMatching was successful and cases and controls were similar in\\nage and ethnicity. Controls were less likely to have \ufb01nished high\\nschool but more likely to have an education beyond high school. A\\nsomewhat larger proportion of the case series were single (12.5%)\\ncompared to the control series (10.0%). Control women were more\\nlikely to have been born outside of the United States (16.8%) than\\nwere cases (12.9%).\\n\\nA total of 42.6% of", " EOC cases reported ever use of talcum powder\\nin the perineal area while 37.1% of control women reported such a\\nhistory. Case women using talc were slightly older at interview than\\ncontrols. Women in the oldest age group used talc less than younger\\nwomen, much more so for control women than case women. White\\nnon-Hispanic women were more likely to use talc than their Hispanic\\ncounterparts. Talc use was higher in both white non-Hispanic and\\nHispanic cases compared to controls but this pattern was not seen in\\nthe \u201cother\u201d ethnic category. Talc use was also associated with a higher\\neducation level. Talc use was higher in both cases and controls with\\nbirthplace in the United States.\\n\\n 10970215, 2004, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.20434, Wiley Online Library on [06/06/2023].

Higher\\nrisks were observed among those who were ever pregnant com-\\npared to those who were never pregnant.

Neither BMI or\\nhormone replacement therapy (HRT) use appeared to modify the\\nrelationship of talc use and EOC risk.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nThe prevalence of talc use among controls in our study (37.1%) is\\nsimilar to the average percentage of use among the control popula-\\ntions in a review of 14 studies (36.8% calculated from data presented\\nin original study).21 In the current analysis as in others,11,21\u201324 a larger\\npercentage of cases versus controls reported perineal exposure to talc.\\nWe found a slight trend of decreasing use with increasing age in\\ncontrol women but our \ufb01ndings were not as strong as those noted by\\nRosenblatt et al.25 Other studies21,24 have found increased use in both\\ncases and controls over 50 years of age compared to their counterparts\\n\\nless than or equal to 50 years of age. In the present study, cases less\\nthan 50 years of age were more likely to have used talc versus women\\n50 years or older (47.7% and 39.9%, respectively). Different \ufb01ndings\\nin talc use patterns between the present study and previous studies\\nmay be explained by differences in st", "udy locations, study time periods\\nand age categories. Frequency of use in the current study was similar\\nfor both the younger and older groups in controls (38.2% and 36.4%,\\nrespectively).\\n\\nTalc use was higher in white non-Hispanics compared to His-\\npanics in this study. However, the pattern of increased use in EOC\\ncases for both groups contributed to the overall increased risk of\\nEOC among talc users. Differential talc use by various ethnic\\ngroups and its relation to EOC risk has not, to our knowledge, been\\nevaluated previously.\\n\\nAs in other studies,21,25 we found that talc use increased with\\neducation level, although one earlier study reported the opposite\\n\ufb01nding.24 Other studies have compared talc use in ever married to\\nnever married women and found either similar use in both groups for\\ncases and controls21 or increased frequency of use in ever married\\nwomen.24 In the current analysis, talc exposure was 43.8% for ever\\nmarried cases versus 34.4% for never married cases. However, fre-\\n\\n 10970215, 2004, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.20434, Wiley Online Library on [06/06/2023].

There was much greater\\nuse of talc among those born in the United States versus those born\\noutside it.\\n\\nThe odds ratio comparing ever use to never use in this study\\n(OR (cid:1) 1.37; CI (cid:1) 1.02\u20131.85) is similar to the results of a recent\\nmetaanalysis that pooled 16 studies (summary RR (cid:1) 1.33; CI (cid:1)\\n1.16 \u20131.45).4 When strati\ufb01ed by hospital- versus population-based\\nstudies, the population studies had a summary relative risk of 1.38\\n(1.25\u20131.52).\\n\\nCornstarch use and ovarian cancer has been evaluated in a small\\nnumber of case-control studies11,21,22,26 and have been reviewed\\nwith the conclusion that no relationship exists between cornstarch\\nand EOC, although the number of study participants using corn-\\nstarch versus talc was small.13 Our study was not able to differ-\\nentiate between use of perineal powders containing talc and those\\ncontaining cornstarch, which may have driven the odds ratio\\ntoward the null. Type of application, including direct application\\non the perineum, or indirect exposure from dusting sanitary nap-\\nkins, underwear and diaphragms (storage) was also not assessed.\\nAs in other studies,4 the present study did not \ufb01nd a clear dose\\nresponse based on duration of use or cumulative use. Limiting the\\nanalysis of dose response to women who reported ever use of talc\\ndid not affect the results (data not shown). The lack of dose\\nresponse between talc use and EOC may be explained by the\\ninability to quantify the actual amount of talc used per application\\nand timing of the application.21 Cramer et al.21 propose that\\napplication during ovulation may pose more risk due to the pos-\\nsibility of talc entrapment in inclusion cysts. Harlow et al.24 found\\nlittle change in odds ratios after excluding use after tubal ligation\\nor hysterectomy in their estimate of total lifetime perineal talc\\napplications. However, when they excluded nonovulatory periods\\nof exposure in their calculation, there was signi\ufb01cant increase in\\nrisk. We were unable to exclude nonovulatory periods and talcum\\npowder use after gynecologic surgery in our cumulative use cal-\\nculations.\\n\\nOur analysis found that talc use and EOC risk varied by histo-\\nlogic subtype, as have others who found that exposure to talc is a\\nsigni\ufb01cant risk for invasive tumors22 and speci\ufb01cally for serous\\ninvasive tumors.21 Cook et al.11 also found an increased risk of\\nserous tumors (including both invasive and borderline) in talc\\nusers versus nonusers. Gertig et al.27 have suggested that there are\\npathologic similarities between serous adenocarcinomas and me-\\nsothelioma that may explain \ufb01ndings of increase risk for serous\\ninvasive tumors in talc users. Harlow et al.24 reported a signi\ufb01cant\\nincrease in risk of either endometrioid or borderline tumors with\\ntalc use and suggest that variation in risk among histologic sub-\\ntypes may be due to chance or a foreign-body effect unique to\\nspeci\ufb01c subtypes.\\n\\nIn a study of the mineral and chemical characterization of\\nconsumer talcum powder formulated prior to June 1973, almost\\nhalf of the samples tested contained 1 of the 3 asbestos group\\nminerals.1 In 1976, talcum powder manufacturers instituted vol-\\nuntary guidelines to prevent asbestos contamination in talc prod-\\nucts,24 but we did not \ufb01nd an increase in EOC risk with talc use on\\nor before 1975; rather, we found that risk of EOC increased with\\nuse after 1975, which may be related to the recency of use. Harlow\\net al.24 observed ovarian cancer risk was in", "creased in women using\\ntalc products before 1960, although Chang and Risch22 found no\\nrelationship between risk and use either before or after 1970.\\n\\nIn the current analysis, a statistically signi\ufb01cant increase in EOC\\nrisk occurred with \ufb01rst use after age 20 compared to \ufb01rst use at\\nyounger ages. Controlling for recency of use did not change this\\n\ufb01nding. Other studies have reported either no trend with age at \ufb01rst\\nuse21 or increased risk of EOC with \ufb01rst use at younger than age\\n20 and older than age 25.24 Disagreement in \ufb01ndings between\\nstudies may be due to differences in age distributions and talc use\\npatterns among study participants. Although we cannot directly\\nassess risk during ovulatory versus nonovulatory periods, our\\n\\n\ufb01ndings of increased risk in adult women support the hypotheses\\nof increased EOC risk with talc exposure during ovulatory periods\\nand in parous reproductive tracts.\\n\\nCramer et al.21 found that EOC risk was increased in parous\\nwomen with talc use occurring before \ufb01rst birth, suggesting that\\nprepregnancy ovarian tissue may be more vulnerable to talc dam-\\nage because it has not undergone stromal differentiation (decidual\\nreaction that occurs during pregnancy). However, their reference\\ngroup was all parous women. In this analysis, we strati\ufb01ed parous\\nwomen by never use, use before \ufb01rst birth and use after \ufb01rst birth.\\nWe found increased risk after \ufb01rst pregnancy. Anatomical changes\\nin the genital tract after pregnancy may increase the possibility of\\ntalc migration to the ovaries.28 Harlow et al.24 suggest that preg-\\nnancy may increase risk due to its effect of increasing the size of\\nthe cervical opening into the uterus. In the current study, perineal\\ntalc use had no apparent impact on EOC risk among those women\\nwho had never been pregnant and parity was dif\ufb01cult to evaluate\\nbecause of the small number of nulliparous women. In 2 prospec-\\ntive studies of talc use and EOC risk, there was no signi\ufb01cant\\ndifference in parity between users and nonusers of talc.25,27\\n\\nHarlow et al.24 reported a signi\ufb01cant increase in EOC risk if\\nperineal talc use occurred in the last 6 months. We also found that\\nrecent users were at increased risk (even when we controlled for\\nduration of use). It is noteworthy that a signi\ufb01cant latency effect is\\nwell documented for asbestos exposure and development of both\\npleural and peritoneal mesotheliomas29 while there appears to be no\\nlatency with talcum powder. The asbestos association has been re-\\nported from an occupational cohort mortality study where exposure is\\nindirect and not the result of direct application, as is the case for\\ntalcum powder.30 This may explain the differences between observed\\npatterns of latency for asbestos and talcum powder. Additionally, risk\\nof EOC with talc use may not be due to talc\u2019s chemical similarity to\\nasbestos but rather due to the ovary\u2019s unique function, resulting in\\nvulnerability to carcinogenesis from particulates such as talc.8 In a\\nstudy of gynecologic surgery and EOC, Green et al.31 found that\\nwomen reporting fallopian tubal occlusion, through tubal ligation or\\nhysterectomy, were at decreased risk for developing EOC. They\\nconcluded that surgical tubal occlusion decreased EOC risk by pre-\\nventing contaminants from reaching the ovary. Ness and Cottreau32\\nproposed that the in\ufb02ammatory response of the ovarian epithelium to\\nvarious irritants may result in ovarian mutagenesis, tumor growth and\\ntumor invasiveness. Cramer et al.21 reported no association between\\nEOC risk and talc use in women with a tubal ligation; however, risk\\nremained nonsigni\ufb01cantly elevated in women with a hysterectomy. A\\nrecent prospective study27 found that EOC risk in talc users was not\\nmodi\ufb01ed by either tubal ligation or hysterectomy. The analysis was\\nnot able to determine the timing of talc use (before or after surgery).\\nIn a hospital-based case-control study, Wong et al.33 found that risk of\\nEOC with talc use was increased in women without gynecologic\\nsurgery and decreased in women with a history of tubal ligation or\\nhysterectomy but neither \ufb01nding was signi\ufb01cant. They also were\\nunable to delineate use before or after gynecologic surgery. Tubal\\nligation may limit a woman\u2019s exposure to contaminants more than\\nhysterectomy since it is usually performed earlier in a woman\u2019s\\nreproductive history, while she is still ovulating.34\\n\\nOral contraceptives (OCs) act by suppression of ovulation and\\nthe fact that elevated risks were found in those talcum powder\\nusers that never used OCs in this study suggests that uninterrupted\\novulation with associated formation of inclusion cysts may en-\\nhance the impact that talcum powder may have on ovarian carci-\\nnogenesis. Unlike our study, however, Cramer et al.21 and Harlow\\net al.24 reported that OCs had no effect on talc use and EOC risk.\\nA prospective study of talc use and ovarian cancer also found that\\nthe prevalence of OC use was similar in both users an", "d nonusers\\nof talc. However, these studies also reported lower percentages of\\nOC use among both cases and controls (talc users and nonusers)\\nthan was found in the present study.\\n\\nOur analysis found that BMI did not modify the risk associated\\nwith talc use and EOC in agreement with Cramer et al.21 Talc use\\n\\n 10970215, 2004, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.20434, Wiley Online Library on [06/06/2023].

Rosenblatt et\\nal.25 in a prospective study found that women in the highest BMI\\nquartile were more likely to use perineal talc. They concluded that\\nsince some studies have found an increased risk for ovarian cancer\\nin obese women, BMI may be a confounder of talc use and ovarian\\ncancer risk. Harlow et al.,24 however, reported no differential use\\nof talc between leaner and heavier controls.\\n\\nThere are several limitations to this study that may limit interpre-\\ntation of the \ufb01ndings. The sample size was relatively small and the\\nresponse fraction lower than ideal. However, we have observed the\\nsame or similar relationships in our study between several risk factors\\nsuch as OC use and parity, as has been observed in several earlier\\nstudies. Recall bias has also been implicated as a limitation in studies\\nof talc and ovarian cancer.35 However, \ufb01ndings in a prospective study,\\nthe Nurses\u2019 Health Study, in which exposure data were collected prior\\nto diagnosis and hence free of recall bias, were similar to the present\\nstudy \ufb01nding for talc use and serous invasive ovarian cancer.27 It has\\nalso been suggested that use of talc is habitual versus memorable and\\nnot likely to be subject to recall bias.35 Huncharek et al.4 suggested\\nthat the positive relationship between talc use and EOC risk found in\\na review of epidemiologic studies may also be explained by a treat-\\nment effect in prevalent cases. The present study used incident cases\\n\\nexclusively. The present analysis was also limited due to our inability\\nto exclude use during nonovulatory periods and posttubal ligation or\\nhysterectomy, nor were we able to differentiate between various\\nformulations.\\n\\nResearch has provided little biologic or experimental evidence to\\nsupport a relationship between talcum powder use and ovarian cancer\\nrisk. However, given the suggestive though uncertain role of talcum\\npowder and EOC found in epidemiologic studies, including the\\npresent study, users should exercise prudence in reducing or elimi-\\nnating use. In this instance, the precautionary principle should be\\ninvoked, especially given that this is a serious form of cancer, usually\\nassociated with a poor prognosis, with no current effective screening\\ntool, steady incidence rates during the last quarter century and no\\nprospect for successful therapy. Unlike other forms of environmental\\nexposures, talcum powder use is easily avoidable.\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\n\\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the contributions of the\\nphysicians and tumor registrars who assisted in the study.

Clinical and epidemiologic studies have indicated the possible exis-\\ntence of an association between ovarian carcinoma and talcum powder use. Talc\\n\\nparticles have been detected in histologic sections of ovarian carcinomas. It has\\n\\nalso been demonstrated that inert particles travel from the perineum to the ovaries.\\n\\nResults from epidemiologic investigations have varied, from risks increased by\\n\\ntwofold to no signi\ufb01cant risk detected.\\nMETHODS. A total of 450 patients with borderline and invasive ovarian carcinoma\\nand 564 population controls in metropolitan Toronto and nearby areas of southern\\n\\nOntario, Canada, were identi\ufb01ed. These subjects were interviewed about their\\n\\nreproductive and menstrual histories as well as their exposure to dusting powders.\\n\\nContinuous unconditional logistic regression methods were used for analysis.\\nRESULTS. Exposure to talc, via sanitary napkins, direct application to the perineum,\\nor both, was signi\ufb01cantly associated with risk of ovarian carcinoma (odds ratio\\n\\n[OR] 1.42, 95% con\ufb01dence interval [CI] 1.08\u20131.86). A borderline-signi\ufb01cant associa-\\n\\ntion was detected between duration of talc exposure and risk (OR 1.09, 95% CI\\n\\n0.98\u20131.21, per 10 years of exposure). No signi\ufb01cant association was found between\\n\\nfrequency of exposure and risk. In comparing invasive and borderline carcinomas,\\n\\nrisk remained elevated for both carcinoma types. Only risk for invasive carcinoma\\n\\nwas statistically signi\ufb01cant.\\nCONCLUSIONS. This investigation supports previous contentions that exposure to\\ntalc may increase risk of ovarian carcinoma. Questionable trends in duration and\\n\\nfrequency of exposure suggest that further studies may be needed to clarify the\\n\\nrole of talc in the etiology of this disease.

Overall, the lifetime risk for the develop-\\nment of ovarian carcinoma is 1.4 in 100.2 Because industrialized\\nnations generally have higher prevalence rates of this disease, envi-\\nronmental exposure has been suggested as an etiologic factor.1\\n\\nAsbestos, a known sclerosing agent, has been shown to cause\\nbronchogenic lung carcinoma and mesothelioma.3 The incidence of\\novarian carcinoma generally increases with greater incidence of as-\\nbestosis.4 Furthermore, female asbestos workers have unusually high\\nnumbers of peritoneal neoplasms, and an association between ovar-\\nian carcinoma and asbestos exposure has also been observed in ani-\\nmal models.2,5 Due to its chemical similarity to asbestos, talc has long\\nbeen suspected as a lung and ovarian carcinogen.2,6 Like asbestos,\\ntalc is a magnesium silicate. Pulverized talc, or talcum powder, is a\\npopular bath and cosmetic product because of its absorbent and\\n\\n/ 7b58$$1136\\n\\n05-18-97 23:46:38\\n\\ncana\\n\\nW: Cancer\\n\\n\fwater-repellent properties. Talcum powder is often\\napplied to sanitary napkins and condoms, as well as\\ndirectly to the perineum, typically after bathing. Early\\npathology studies have identi\ufb01ed talc particles in ovar-\\nian tumors.7,8 An extraction-replication technique de-\\nveloped by Henderson et al.7 detected talc particles\\nin approximately 75% of ovarian tumors examined.\\nFurthermore, studies of the transport of particles in\\nthe human female reproductive tract have shown that\\nnonmotile, inert carbon particles deposited in the va-\\ngina can be recovered 30 \u2013 35 minutes later in the fallo-\\npian tubes.9 Although \ufb01ndings of talc particles in ovar-\\nian tumors initially met with skepticism, subsequent\\nevaluations appeared to support the contention of an\\nassociation between talc exposure and ovarian carci-\\nnoma.10\\n\\nIn addition to pathologic and clinical studies, sev-\\neral epidemiologic studies have addressed the plausi-\\nbility of an association between talc and ovarian carci-\\nnoma. Although many of these case-control studies\\nrevealed elevated risks,11 \u2013 18 risk estimates from other\\nstudies were not statistically signi\ufb01cant19 \u2013 20 or were\\nabout unity.21 Thus, the possibility of a risk of ovarian", "\\ncarcinoma that is related to talc exposure remains to\\nbe investigated further. The population-based case-\\ncontrol analysis described in this article was con-\\nducted to examine the role of talc in ovarian carci-\\nnoma, with consideration of the duration, frequency,\\nand method of exposure.\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nStudy methods have been reported in detail else-\\nwhere22 and will be summarized here. Our study popu-\\nlation consisted of women between the ages of 35 and\\n79 years residing in the highly populated area sur-\\nrounding the western end of Lake Ontario, Canada.\\nCases were women who had histologically con\ufb01rmed\\nprimary, invasive or borderline epithelial ovarian tu-\\nmors \ufb01rst diagnosed between November 1, 1989, and\\nOctober 31, 1992. Of the 631 women identi\ufb01ed as\\ncases, 450 (71.3%) were interviewed. Fifty-\ufb01ve (8.7%)\\nhad died, but proxy interviews were not conducted; 29\\n(4.6%) had physicians who refused consent; 30 (4.8%)\\nwere too ill to participate; 17 (2.7%) were lost to follow-\\nup; and 50 (7.9%) refused to participate.\\n\\nPopulation-based controls were identi\ufb01ed through\\nthe Ontario Ministry of Finance. Information on name,\\naddress, age, and gender was obtained from the Enu-\\nmeration Composite Record listings, which include all\\nhomeowners, tenants, and family members, i.e., all\\npersons in the province. From this listing, women liv-\\ning in the study area during the same 3-year period\\nas the cases were randomly selected. Controls were\\nmatched to the cases within 3 15-year age groups.\\n\\nTalc and Ovarian Carcinoma/Chang and Risch\\n\\n2397\\n\\nInitial contact by letter was followed up with phone\\ncalls to determine eligibility. Women with bilateral oo-\\nphorectomy performed at least 1 year previously were\\nexcluded. Overall, 873 eligible controls were identi\ufb01ed.\\nOf these women, 564 (64.5%) were interviewed. The\\nremainder either refused to participate (30.2%), were\\ntoo ill to participate (1.9%), or were lost to follow-up\\n(3.2%).\\n\\nA questionnaire was developed to detail the medi-\\ncal and reproductive histories of the subjects. This\\nquestionnaire was administered during an in-person,\\nin-home interview after informed consent was ob-\\ntained. The questionnaire focused on menstrual char-\\nacteristics, pregnancies, and hormone and contracep-\\ntive use. Questions about regular talc use and type of\\ntalc use, as well as questions from which information\\nabout duration and frequency of exposure could be\\nderived, were included. Dusting or powdering behav-\\niors considered included regular application of talc to\\nthe perineum after showering or bathing and dusting\\nof talc on sanitary napkins. Parallel information about\\ncornstarch use was also obtained.\\n\\nAnalysis was performed by modeling the data\\nthrough multiple unconditional\\nlogistic regression\\nwith the SAS statistical package. In addition to the\\nvariables of interest examined here, the models in-\\ncluded indicator terms for the age categories of the\\nfrequency matching (35 \u2013 49, 50 \u2013 64, and 65 \u2013 79 years),\\nand age as a continuous variable was also included to\\nadjust for residual age effects. Models also contained\\nterms for total years of oral contraceptive use; number\\nof\\naverage duration of\\nbreastfeeding per pregnancy; and ever having had a\\ntubal ligation, a hysterectomy, or a mother or sister\\nwith ovarian or breast carcinoma.\\n\\nfull-term pregnancies;\\n\\nRESULTS\\nTable 1 shows the descriptive characteristics of the\\n450 ovarian carcinoma cases and the 564 population\\ncontrols. Age at interview was used as a matching vari-\\nable. As observed in many reports,20,22,23 controls had,\\non average, a greater number of full-term pregnancies.\\nA higher percentage of controls had had a tubal liga-\\ntion or a hysterectomy, whereas a higher percentage\\nof cases had a mother or sister with ovarian or breast\\ncarcinoma. Years of oral contraceptive use and months\\nof lactation per pregnancy showed trends of decreas-\\ning risk with increasing exposure. There were no ap-\\npreciable differences in the characteristics shown in\\nTable 1 between controls who reported ever having\\nused talc and those not reporting talc use.\\n\\nTable 2 gives the associations between dusting be-\\nhaviors and risk of ovarian carcinoma.

Women with any regular talc exposure were at\\nan increased risk (odds ratio [OR] 1.42, 95% con\ufb01dence\\ninterval [CI] 1.08 \u2013 1.86). The use of cornstarch, or corn-\\nstarch sometimes and talc sometimes, did not yield a\\nsigni\ufb01cant association with risk (cornstarch OR 0.31,\\n95% CI 0.06 \u2013 1.66; cornstarch/talc OR 0.68, 95% CI\\n0.18 \u2013 2.55). However, application of cornstarch to san-\\nitary napkins or directly to the perineum was not com-\\nmon in this population; less than 2% of the study pop-\\nulation reported this behavior. With respect to the type\\nof exposure, substantially more women reported\\napplying talc to their bodies after bathing or showering\\nthan using talc on their sanitary napkins. Some 11.3%\\nof cases and 8.7% of controls reported using talc on\\nsanitary napkins. A nonsigni\ufb01cant increase in odds\\nwas observed for talc exposure via sanitary napkins\\n(OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.81 \u2013 1.96). In total, 38.2% of cases\\nand 32.4% of controls reported that they had, at some\\ntime, regularly used talc after bathing or showering.\\nThe odds ratio seen for use of talc after bathing or\\nshowering alone was of borderline statistical signi\ufb01-\\ncance (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.00 \u2013 1.73).\\n\\nThe association between duration and frequency\\nof talc use and ovarian carcinoma was also examined.\\nThe mean years of after-bath talc use were 32.9 for\\ncases who had ever used talc after bathing and 35.4\\nfor controls. A borderline-signi\ufb01cant trend for years of\\ntalc exposure and risk of ovarian carcinoma was found\\n(OR per 10 years of use 1.06, 95% CI 0.99 \u2013 1.14). When\\nduration was considered categorized by tertiles of con-\\ntrol use, only durations of less than 30 years of talc\\n\\nuse showed increased risk, relative to no talc exposure.\\nThe mean frequency of talc use among those who had\\never used it was 14.6 applications per month for cases;\\nfor controls, it was 17.2 applications per month. As a\\ncontinuous variable, monthly frequency did not sig-\\nni\ufb01cantly increase risk of ovarian carcinoma. Cate-\\ngoric analysis of frequency showed that frequencies of\\nless than 10 applications per month may be associated\\nwith increased risk; greater frequencies, however, did\\nnot show signi\ufb01cant increases in risk.\\n\\nTo examine the effects of calendar time of expo-\\nsure and of hysterectomy or tubal ligation, we as-\\nsumed that regular after-bath talc use commenced at\\nage 20 years. Table 2 shows that duration of after-bath\\ntalc use both before and after 1970 appeared to be\\nassociated with risk of ovarian carcinoma. As might\\nbe expected, the increased risk seemed to be related\\nmostly to talc use prior to tubal ligation or hysterec-\\ntomy (Table 2). There were no differences in these\\nresults when various starting ages between 15 and 25\\nyears were considered.\\n\\nThe association between talc exposure and inva-\\nsive ovarian carcinoma, as compared with borderline\\novarian carcinoma, was also examined (Table 3). Al-\\nthough the risk remained elevated for both carcinoma\\ntypes, only the risk for invasive carcinoma was statisti-\\ncally signi\ufb01cant. No differences in risk with respect\\nto serous, mucinous, or endometrioid tumors were\\nobserved in our data.\\n\\nSubstantial alteration in risk of ovarian carcinoma\\nwas not observed for general sanitary napkin use com-\\n\\n/ 7b58$$1136\\n\\n05-18-97 23:46:38\\n\\ncana\\n\\nW: Cancer\\n\\n 10970142, 1997, 12, Downloaded from https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19970615)79:12<2396::AID-CNCR15>3.0.CO;2-M, Wiley Online Library on [06/06/2023].

Histologic\\nevidence \ufb01rst indicated that contaminants such talc\\nmay become embedded in ovarian tumors.8,24 Experi-\\nmental studies have shown that external talc exposure\\nmay eventually reach the ovaries. Henderson et al.10\\ndemonstrated that talc was present in ovaries after\\ndeposition of a talc suspension in the vagina and cervi-\\ncal os in rats. Similarly, Egli and Newton9 revealed in\\nhuman studies that inert carbon particles deposited\\nin the vagina can later be recovered in the fallopian\\ntubes. Although these studies demonstrated a possible\\nroute of exposure to talc, they were nevertheless un-\\nable to address the effects of long term talc use.\\n\\nSurprisingly, few subsequent pathologic and clini-\\ncal studies have been conducted. Epidemiologic stud-\\nies addressing the possible association between talc\\nand ovarian carcinoma have generally reported in-\\ncreased risk estimates. Cramer et al.11 found a relative\\nrisk of 1.92 (95% CI 1.3 \u2013 2.9). Rosenblatt et al.12 re-\\nported a relative risk of 2.4 (95% CI 1.1 \u2013 5.3) for any\\ngenital talc exposure.

Talc expo-\\nsure through direct perineal application and via sani-\\ntary napkins, the frequency and duration of exposure,\\nand the effect of talc within speci\ufb01c histologic sub-\\ntypes were examined. Dusting with talcum powder\\nwas common behavior for more than one-third of\\ncases and controls. The primary mode of talc exposure\\nappeared to be direct application to the p", "erineum.\\nAlthough talc exposure via contraceptives such as con-\\ndoms and diaphragms has been previously investi-\\ngated,27 this type of behavior was rare in the current\\nstudy population and therefore omitted from analyses.\\nOverall, greater risk was associated with any regular\\ntalc exposure (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.08 \u2013 1.86). Any talc\\nexposure included talc accumulated from sanitary\\nnapkins, from powdering after bathing, or from both\\nbehaviors. Talc exposures via sanitary napkin alone or\\nafter bathing conveyed similar magnitudes of\\nin-\\ncreased risk.\\n\\nCommercial talc substitutes often replace talc\\nwith cornstarch. Furthermore, women may choose to\\npowder or dust with cornstarch instead of talc. When\\ncornstarch was assessed in relation to risk of ovarian\\ncarcinoma, no associations were found. This suggests\\nthat the association between talc use and risk of ovar-\\nian carcinoma may not be due simply to a difference\\nin focus on hygiene between cases and controls. Use\\nof cornstarch, however, was rare in our population, as\\nless than 1% of the cases and controls reported use\\nof cornstarch alone, and very few cases and controls\\nreported use of cornstarch sometimes and talc some-\\ntimes.\\n\\nA questionable dose-response relationship was\\nobserved between duration or frequency of exposure\\nand risk. Duration as a continuous variable indicated\\nthat risk may increase with increasing years of talc\\nexposure. These results are similar to \ufb01ndings by\\nCramer et al.,11 Harlow et al.,13 Harlow and Weiss,28\\nCook et al.,18 and Whittemore et al.,19 in which trends\\nof duration and frequency were not signi\ufb01cant. Booth\\net al.23 reported a marginally signi\ufb01cant trend with\\nfrequency. It is noteworthy that exposures of less than\\n\\n30 years, at frequencies of less than 10 applications\\nper month, and prior to tubal ligation or hysterectomy\\nshowed the most signi\ufb01cant elevations in risk in the\\ncurrent study.\\n\\nWhen the outcome, ovarian carcinoma, was fur-\\nther segregated into invasive and borderline carcino-\\nmas, talc exposure was associated with both but was\\nonly signi\ufb01cant for invasive carcinomas. This result\\ncontrasts with the observations of Harlow et al.,13 who\\nfound the strongest talc \u2013 ovarian carcinoma associa-\\ntions among women with endometrioid and border-\\nline tumors. Cook et al.18 reported no increase in risk\\nof mucinous tumors; this was similar to our observa-\\ntion that mucinous tumors may not be associated with\\nother ovarian carcinoma risk factors.29 An earlier\\nstudy, however, found no variation in risk by histologic\\nsubtype,11 and the current study also found no differ-\\nences in talc use associated with serous, mucinous, or\\nendometrioid tumors.\\n\\nSeveral lines of evidence support the argument for\\nan association between talc usage and ovarian carci-\\nnoma. Talc and asbestos are chemically related; and\\nalthough asbestos contamination in talc products has\\nbeen closely regulated, talc and asbestos are frequently\\nfound together in mining strata. Asbestos is a known\\ncause of pleural and peritoneal mesotheliomas, which\\nare histologically similar to ovarian carcinomas.19 Two\\npossible mechanisms have been suggested for the role\\nof talc in the etiology of ovarian carcinoma. With ovu-\\nlation, entrapment of the ovarian epithelium within\\nthe stroma occurs. During this time, talc, if present,\\nmay become incorporated into these inclusion cysts,\\nproviding a favorable environment for carcinogene-\\nsis.11 Alternatively, talc may serve to stimulate the en-\\ntrapment of the surface epithelium and may act in a\\nmanner similar to \u2018\u2018incessant ovulation,\u2019\u2019 which has\\nbeen proposed as an etiologic factor in ovarian carci-\\nnoma.11,30\\n\\nDifferences in talc concentration among various\\nbaby powders, body powders, and deodorizing pow-\\nders were not investigated in this study. Furthermore,\\nreporting error in reported talc use and failure to inter-\\nview all eligible case and control subjects may also\\nhave led to biases. As with any case-control study,\\nthe possibility of selection bias and information bias\\nexists, although the consistency of this study with oth-\\ners that have addressed reproductive factors and ovar-\\nian carcinoma is reassuring.23 Further discussion of\\nthe strengths and weaknesses of the current study may\\nbe found in a previous report.23\\n\\nThe results of this study appear to support the\\ncontention that talc exposure increases risk of ovarian\\ncarcinoma.

Positive associations reported in case-control studies have not been\\nconfirmed in cohort studies.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE To estimate the association between use of powder in the genital area and ovarian\\ncancer using prospective observational data.\\n\\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data were pooled from 4 large, US-based cohorts:\\nNurses\u2019 Health Study (enrollment 1976; follow-up 1982-2016; n = 81 869), Nurses\u2019 Health\\nStudy II (enrollment 1989; follow-up 2013-2017; n = 61 261), Sister Study (enrollment\\n2003-2009; follow-up 2003-2017; n = 40 647), and Women\u2019s Health Initiative Observational\\nStudy (enrollment 1993-1998; follow-up 1993-2017; n = 73 267).\\n\\nEXPOSURES Ever, long-term ((cid:2)20 years), and frequent ((cid:2)1/week) use of powder in the\\ngenital area.\\n\\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary analysis examined the association between\\never use of powder in the genital area and self-reported incident ovarian cancer.\\nCovariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using Cox proportional\\nhazards models.\\n\\nRESULTS The pooled sample included 252 745 women (median age at baseline, 57 years) with\\n38% self-reporting use of powder in the genital area. Ten percent reported long-term use,\\nand 22% reported frequent use. During a median of 11.2 years of follow-up (3.8 million\\nperson-years at risk), 2168 women developed ovarian cancer (58 cases/100 000\\nperson-years). Ovarian cancer incidence was 61 cases/100 000 person-years among ever\\nusers and 55 cases/100 000 person-years among never users (estimated risk difference at\\nage 70 years, 0.09% [95% CI, \u22120.02% to 0.19%]; estimated HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.99 to 1.17]).\\nThe estimated HR for frequent vs never use was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.23) and for long-term\\nvs never use, the HR was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.82 to 1.25). Subgroup analyses were conducted for\\n10 variables; the tests for heterogeneity were not statistically significant for any of these\\ncomparisons. While the estimated HR for the association between ever use of powder in the\\ngenital area and ovarian cancer risk among women with a patent reproductive tract was 1.13\\n(95% CI, 1.01 to 1.26), the P value for interaction comparing women with vs without patent\\nreproductive tracts was .15.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this analysis of pooled data from women in 4 US cohorts,\\nthere was not a statistically significant association between use of powder in the genital area\\nand incident ovarian cancer.

Most powder prod-\\nucts include some mineral talc.1 Talc was first investigated as\\na carcinogen based on its relationship to asbestos, which has\\nknown carcinogenic effects2 and may be mined in the same\\nlocations. However, all US-based manufacturers of cosmetic\\ntalc agreed to ban asbestos in 1976,3 and the International\\nAgency for Research on Cancer has since concluded there is\\nonly \u201cpossible\u201d evidence that perineal use of talc-based body\\npowder may be carcinogenic.1\\n\\nThis classification was largely based on evidence from ob-\\nservational studies. Case-control studies have reported posi-\\ntive associations between ever use of powder in the genital area\\nand ovarian cancer, with an estimated odds ratio of 1.24 in a\\npooled analysis4 and 1.31 in a meta-analysis.5 However, these\\nfindings may be affected by recall bias,6,7 and a recent surge\\nin talc-related lawsuits and media coverage8,9 has increased\\nthis possibility. Thus, it is crucial to evaluate the talc\u2013ovarian\\ncancer association using prospective data.\\n\\nTo date, 3 large cohort studies have assessed the asso-\\nciation between use of powder in the genit", "al area and\\novarian cancer risk, with inconsistent results.10-12 However,\\novarian cancer is a rare disease (1.3% lifetime risk in the\\nUnited States),13 and individual cohort studies are not suffi-\\nciently powered to detect modest associations, particularly\\nif restricted to susceptible subgroups, such as women with\\npatent reproductive tracts (ie, having an intact uterus and\\nno tubal ligation).\\n\\nTo better examine the association between use of powder\\nin the genital area and risk of ovarian cancer, 4 large US\\ncohorts that collected the necessary information were identi-\\nfied: the Nurses\u2019 Health Study (NHS), Nurses\u2019 Health Study II\\n(NHSII), Sister Study (SIS), and Women\u2019s Health Initiative\\nObservational Study (WHI-OS). While associations between\\ngenital use of powder and ovarian cancer risk have been\\nreported for 3 of these (NHS, WHI-OS, and SIS),10-12 the\\npooled results reported here incorporate updated data,\\nincluding additional cases and longer follow-up.\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nStudy Sample\\nThe study designs of these 4 US-based cohorts have been de-\\nscribed in detail elsewhere.14-16 Briefly, the NHS (n = 121 700)\\nenrolled registered nurses living in the United States in\\n1976, and the NHSII (n = 116 429) did the same in 1989. The\\nstudy protocols were approved by the institutional review\\nboards of the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, the Harvard\\nT.H. Chan School of Public Health, and those of participat-\\ning registries, as required. All participants provided written,\\ninformed consent. Although the initial questionnaires\\ndid not ask about genital use of powder, participants were\\nqueried about powder use on the 1982 NHS and 2013 NHSII\\nquestionnaires. We only included follow-up time after\\nthe questionnaire about use of powder in the genital area\\nwas administered and will refer to the questionnaire that\\n\\nKey Points\\n\\nQuestion Is use of powder in the genital area associated with the\\nrisk of developing ovarian cancer?\\n\\nFindings In this analysis that pooled data from 4 cohorts with\\na total of 252 745 women, the hazard ratio for the association\\nbetween self-reported ever use vs never use of powder in the\\ngenital area and incident ovarian cancer was 1.08 (95% CI,\\n0.99-1.17).\\n\\nMeaning Among women from 4 prospective cohorts, there was\\nnot a statistically significant association between use of powder in\\nthe genital area and ovarian cancer, but the study may have been\\nunderpowered to identify a small increase in risk.\\n\\nassessed powder use as baseline to maintain consistent lan-\\nguage across all 4 studies.\\n\\nGenital use of powder was assessed at enrollment for SIS\\nbetween 2003 and 2009 (n = 50 884) and for WHI-OS be-\\ntween 1993 and 1998 (n = 93 676). Women were eligible for\\nSIS if they had a sister previously diagnosed with breast cancer\\nbut had no personal diagnosis of breast cancer at enrollment.\\nEligible participants in WHI-OS were postmenopausal women\\nwho resided near one of 40 clinical centers. Both studies were\\napproved by the relevant institutional review boards and all\\nparticipants provided written, informed consent.\\n\\nExposure Assessment\\nThe cohorts differed in how they asked participants about\\nuse of powder in the genital area (eAppendix in the Supple-\\nment). NHS participants were asked whether they \u201cever\\ncommonly used talcum, baby powder or deodorizing\\npowder\u201d on their \u201cperineal (private) area\u201d (no, <1/week,\\n1-6 times/week, daily) or on sanitary napkins (yes/no). The\\nNHSII questionnaire asked women to report use only if it\\noccurred at least weekly in the \u201cgenital/rectal area or on\\nsanitary napkins, tampons, or underwear\u201d and if so, for how\\nlong (<1 year, 1-<10 years, 10-<20 years, 20-<30 years,\\n30+ years). In SIS, the question specifically focused on use\\nof talcum powder and application to \u201ca sanitary napkin,\\nunderwear, diaphragm, or cervical cap, or directly to the\\nvaginal area\u201d in the last year or at the ages of 10 to 13 years.\\nParticipants were queried about their frequency of use in\\nthe year prior to enrollment (never, <1/mo, 1-3 times/mo,\\n1-5 times/week, >5 times/week), as well as use during the\\nages 10-13 (did not use, sometimes, frequently). Women in\\nWHI-OS were asked if they had ever used powder on their\\n\u201cprivate parts (genital areas)\u201d (yes/no) and for how long they\\nhad used it (<1 year, 1-4 years, 5-9 years, 10-19 years, 20+\\nyears), with similar questions for powder use on diaphragms\\nor sanitary pads.\\n\\nTo harmonize across the 4 studies, we defined women as\\never vs never users of powder on genital areas. For SIS, ever\\nuse included use in the last year or at ages 10 to 13 years. We\\nwere also able to examine long-term use, which we defined as\\nuse of powder on genitals for at least 20 years (NHSII and WHI-\\nOS) or use at ages 10 to 13 years and also in the last year (SIS).\\nFrequent users were those who reported use of powder in the\\n\\n50\\n\\nJAMA January 7, 2020 Volume 323, Number 1\\n\\n(Reprinted)\\n\\njama.com\\n\\n\u00a9 2020 American Medi", "cal Association.

Those reporting incident\\ncancers were asked to grant access to their medical records,\\nwhich were reviewed for confirmation of the diagnosis and\\ndisease details. Additional cases were identified from among\\ndeceased participants via National Death Index searches.\\nThe protocol for SIS was similar, except follow-up question-\\nnaires were collected annually and most participants pro-\\nvided pathology reports rather than complete medical rec-\\nords. Participants in WHI-OS were also asked to self-report\\ncancers on annual questionnaires, but only medically con-\\nfirmed cases were counted. All 4 studies categorized tumors\\noriginating in the ovary, peritoneum, and fallopian tubes as\\novarian cancers.\\n\\nFor NHS, NHSII, and SIS, delays in the confirmation pro-\\ncess and incomplete retrieval of medical records meant that\\nnot all self-reported cases could be medically confirmed. We\\nran sensitivity analyses limited to medically confirmed\\ncases but included all self-reported diagnoses in our main\\nanalyses. Subtype analyses were limited to medically con-\\nfirmed cases.\\n\\nCovariates\\nAll 4 studies had substantial covariate data, which we har-\\nmonized into a common set of potential confounders or\\neffect modifiers. The following data were included: age at\\nbaseline (continuous), race (white, black, other), education\\n(\u2264high school, some college, completed college), body mass\\nindex (BMI [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by\\nheight in meters squared], restricted cubic spline), parity\\n(nulliparous, 1 birth, 2 births, \u22653 births), smoking status\\n(never, former, current), oral contraceptive use (ever/never),\\nhormone therapy use (ever/never), tubal ligation status\\n(yes/no), hysterectomy status (yes/no), and menopausal sta-\\ntus (premenopausal/postmenopausal). Race was self-\\nreported by the participant, based on provided categories. It\\nwas considered to be an important confounder because\\nboth ovarian cancer rates13 and genital powder use vary by\\nrace/ethnicity. Only baseline levels of these covariates were\\nconsidered as confounders, though we did consider post-\\nbaseline changes in menopausal status when assessing\\neffect modification.\\n\\nStatistical Analyses\\nWe used Cox proportional hazards models with age as the pri-\\nmary time scale to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs\\nmeasuring the association between genital use of powder and\\nincident ovarian cancer, adjusting for potential confounders.\\nWe selected potential confounders using a directed acyclic\\ngraph framework,17 considering covariates that were possi-\\nbly related to use of powder in the genital area and also ovar-\\nian cancer risk.\\n\\nWe excluded women who had ovarian cancer or a bilat-\\neral oophorectomy prior to baseline, or who were missing\\ninformation on powder use or age at ovarian cancer diagno-\\nsis. For regression analyses, we additionally excluded women\\nwith missing data for 1 or more covariates. Women under-\\nwent follow-up from age at baseline until ovarian cancer\\ndiagnosis, with censoring at bilateral oophorectomy, end of\\nfollow-up, or death from causes other than ovarian cancer.\\nAn exception was made for WHI-OS because postbase-\\nline oophorectomy data were not collected. Participants\\nin SIS and WHI-OS who were no longer actively respond-\\ning to follow-up requests were censored at age of last con-\\ntact, although their follow-up continued via linkage to the\\nNational Death Index.\\n\\nTo better control for differences across studies, we\\nallowed the baseline hazard function to vary across cohorts\\nby implementing study-stratified Cox models. We tested\\nfor study heterogeneity by conducting likelihood ratio tests\\ncomparing models with and without study \u00d7 powder inter-\\naction terms. For the primary analysis of ever vs never pow-\\nder use and ovarian cancer risk, we additionally calculated\\nthe effect estimate and the P value for heterogeneity from\\na random-effects meta-analysis.18 Proportional hazards\\nassumptions were tested via likelihood ratio tests of pow-\\nder \u00d7 time interaction terms.\\n\\nBecause patency is required for there to be a direct physi-\\ncal pathway between the powder application area and the\\novaries, we hypothesized a priori that women with patent\\nreproductive tracts would be more susceptible to the effects\\nof powder use in the genital area on ovarian cancer. We there-\\nfore conducted analyses restricted to this subgroup. When\\nestimating the effects of dura", "tion of powder use on ovarian\\ncancer risk, we compared long-term (\u226520 years) and non\u2013\\nlong-term users with never users. Similarly, we compared fre-\\nquent users (\u22651/week) and nonfrequent users with never\\nusers. We conducted trend tests using the ordinal forms of\\nthese variables.\\n\\nWe also conducted exploratory analyses to examine\\nwhether the association between powder use in the genital area\\nand ovarian cancer varied by subgroup. These categoriza-\\ntions were selected based on the existing literature or hypoth-\\neses about potential biological mechanisms and included age,\\nrace/ethnicity, menopausal hormone therapy use, BMI, and\\nparity. We also considered time-varying menopausal status and\\nfollow-up time as effect modifiers and more formally com-\\npared subgroups defined by hysterectomy, tubal ligation and\\npatency status. We evaluated heterogeneity across strata of\\neach potential effect modifier by conducting likelihood ratio\\ntests of the interaction between that factor and powder use in\\nthe genital area.\\n\\nFor analyses limited to medically confirmed cases of\\novarian cancer, we censored unconfirmed cases at their\\nself-reported age of diagnosis.

The covariate-adjusted risk differ-\\nence for the association between frequent powder use and\\novarian cancer among women with patent reproductive tracts\\nwas 0.22% (95% CI, 0.02% to 0.42%), and the HR was 1.19 (95%\\nCI, 1.03 to 1.37; P value for trend = .03).\\n\\nWhen the outcome was limited to medically confirmed\\ncases, the HR was attenuated (Table 4; HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.96\\nto 1.16] for ever use vs never use). There were no notable dif-\\nferences in estimates by invasive status, tumor location, or his-\\ntotype. This was also true for analyses limited to women with\\npatent reproductive tracts (eTable 4 in the Supplement). When\\nlimited to the older cohorts (NHS and WHI-OS), the esti-\\nmated pooled HR was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.19) for ever use\\nvs never use. The estimated HR from the young cohorts (NHSII\\nand SIS) was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.75 to 1.26).\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nIn this pooled analysis of 4 large US cohorts, there was no sta-\\ntistically significant association between self-reported use of\\npowder in the genital area and risk of ovarian cancer. There\\nwere no clear dose-response trends for duration and fre-\\nquency of powder use in the genital area in relation to ovar-\\nian cancer risk. Although the study was underpowered to de-\\ntect small changes in risk, this is, to our knowledge, the largest\\nstudy of this topic to date, and it is believed that no other large\\nprospective cohorts have collected data on powder exposure\\nin the genital area.\\n\\nOne of the primary drivers of research on genital use of\\ntalc-based products and ovarian cancer has been the poten-\\ntial link between talc and asbestos, which can occur together\\nin nature. In an analysis limited to the older cohorts in which\\nwomen may have started using powder before the asbestos\\nban of 1976, the estimated effect remained consistent, with\\nno association observed in the younger cohorts. However,\\nit was recently suggested that some products may have\\ncontained asbestos after 1976, meaning that there may not\\nbe a clearly defined time period in which talc-based products\\ndid or did not contain asbestos. 2 2 Further, although\\nmost cosmetic powder products include some quantity of\\nmineral talc,1 the percentage varies widely,23 and exposure to\\nasbestos (through talc) would also depend on the type of\\nproduct used and the method of application (eg, underwear\\nvs diaphragm).\\n\\nBy irritating epithelial ovarian tissue or fallopian tubes24\\ndirectly, powder could induce an inflammatory response even\\nin the absence of asbestos. This could set off a cascade of in-\\ncreased oxidative stress levels, DNA damage, and cell divi-\\nsion, all of which could contribute to carcinogenesis.25 In this\\nanalysis, there was a possible positive association among\\nwomen with patent reproductive tracts (no history of hyster-\\nectomy or tubal ligation), although because the association was\\nnot significantly different from that observed in women with\\nnonpatent reproductive tracts, this finding should be consid-\\nered only exploratory and hypothesis generating. This obser-\\nvation lends support to the hypothesis that powder with or\\nwithout asbestos could irritate and inflame the reproductive\\n\\n56\\n\\nJAMA January 7, 2020 Volume 323, Number 1\\n\\n(Reprinted)\\n\\njama.com\\n\\n\u00a9 2020 American Medical Association.

As highlighted by\\nTrabert,7 the African American Cancer Epidemiology Study6\\nfound evidence supporting this phenomenon. Based on the\\ntiming of the first major talc lawsuits,30 Schildkraut et al6\\nstratified their results by year of interview (earlier than 2014\\nvs 2014 or later), observing that among women interviewed\\nearlier, ever use of powder in the genital area was less-\\nstrongly associated with ovarian cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.19\\n[95% CI, 0.87 to 1.63]) than among women interviewed later\\n(OR, 2.91 [95% CI, 1.70 to 4.97]). This difference was driven\\nby an increase in the reported prevalence of powder use\\namong case participants (36.5% vs 51.5% of women inter-\\nviewed early vs later), while self-reported use in the control\\npartcipants remained stable (34.0% vs 34.4%). However,\\nmost of the case-control studies that have examined this\\nassociation recruited well before 2014, and a large pooled\\nanalysis published in 2013 reported an OR of 1.24 (95% CI,\\n1.15 to 1.33).4 For the current analysis, recall bias was avoided\\nby excluding those with preexisting ovarian cancer.\\n\\nThe strengths of this study were large sample size and\\nlong follow-up time. The main analysis included 2168 ovarian\\ncancer cases that developed over 3.8 million person-years.\\nThis far exceeds a previous meta-analysis of the published\\nNHS, SIS, and WHI-OS results (890 cases over 182 000\\nperson-years).5 However, power to investigate links to perito-\\nneal or fallopian tube cancers or histotypes other than serous\\nwas still low. Improvements in the classification of tumor\\ntypes may contribute new insights, especially for fallopian\\ntube cancers, which may be the true point of origin for most\\nserous ovarian cancers.24 This and other subtype-specific\\nassociations should be better examined in the future.\\n\\nLimitations\\nThis study has several limitations. First, the included\\ncohorts varied widely in how they assessed exposure, par-\\nticularly the duration and frequency of powder use. There\\nwas no evidence of between-study heterogeneity for either\\nthe pooled or meta-analysis models of ever use vs never use,\\nbut because the 2 largest studies were missing information\\n\\non duration (NHS) and frequency (WHI-OS) of powder use,\\nthe dose-response analyses are underpowered compared\\nwith the main results and thus difficult to interpret. Second,\\nuse of powder in the genital area could not be assessed as a\\ntime-varying factor, as none of the 4 studies collected data\\non use after baseline.\\n\\nThird, specific exposure windows could not be exam-\\nined, nor could type of powder used or patency status at\\ntime of powder use. As previously noted, information on\\npowder exposure is typically more limited in cohort studies\\ncompared with case-control studies, particularly with\\nrespect to dose and duration of use.31 Therefore, ongoing or\\nfuture cohort studies should collect detailed information\\non these topics.\\n\\nFourth, as with all observational studies, residual con-\\nfounding is possible. All 4 included studies recorded detailed\\ninformation on many potential confounders, which were har-\\nmonized across cohorts and adjusted for in multivariable mod-\\nels. However, residual confounding may still be present if the\\nharmonized covariates did not adequately capture the rela-\\ntionship or if any key confounders were missing.\\n\\nFifth, the study may have limited generalizability. All 4 co-\\nhorts included predominately white, well-educated women,\\napproximately half of whom had a BMI of less than 25, which\\ncould raise concerns about generalizability, especially since\\nthese factors may be related to powder use. However, these\\nstudies have high retention rates and accurate self-reported\\ndata, increasing internal validity.\\n\\nSixth, confounding by indication is another potential\\nlimitation, and it would occur if women with other underly-\\ning conditions that were associated with ovarian cancer were\\nalso more likely to use powder in the genital area. It is also\\npossible that if powder use is associated with increased risk\\nof other gynecologic conditions (eg, fibroids, ovarian cysts), it\\ncan affect whether women receive oophorectomies, hyster-\\nectomies, or tubal ligations and alter their risk of developing\\novarian cancer. Seventh, because tests to confirm patency\\nwere not performed, it is possible that not all women catego-\\nrized as having a patent reproductive tract in this analysis\\nhad truly patent tubes.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nIn this analysis of pooled data from women in 4 US cohorts,\\nthere was not a statistically significant association between self-\\nreported use of powder in the genital area and incident ovar-\\nian cancer. However, the study may have been underpow-\\nered to identify a small increase in risk.\\n\\nARTICLE INFORMATION\\n\\nAccepted for Publication: Novemb", "er 16, 2019.\\n\\nAuthor Affiliations: Epidemiology Branch, National\\nInstitute of Environmental Health Sciences,\\nResearch Triangle Park, North Carolina (O\u2019Brien,\\nSandler); Department of Cancer Epidemiology, H.\\nLee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute,\\nTampa, Florida (Tworoger); Department of\\n\\nEpidemiology, Harvard T.H.

Seeking \\ngreater clarity, we examined this association in 2,041 cases with epi-\\nthelial ovarian cancer and 2,100 age- and-residence-matched controls.\\nMethods: We defined genital talc use as regular application to the geni-\\ntal/rectal area directly, on sanitary napkins, tampons, or underwear. to \\nestimate \u201ctalc-years,\u201d we multiplied applications per year by years used. \\nUnconditional logistic regression, Wald statistics, likelihood-ratio tests, \\nand polytomous logistic regression were used to calculate adjusted odds \\nratios (Or) and 95% confidence intervals (ci), trends, effect-modifica-\\ntion, and heterogeneity by ovarian cancer histologic subtype.\\nResults: Overall, genital talc use was associated with an Or (95% \\nci)  of  1.33  (1.16,  1.52),  with  a  trend  for  increasing  risk  by  talc-\\nyears. Women who used talc were more likely to be older, heavier, \\nasthma sufferers, and regular analgesic users\u2014none of which was a \\nconfounder. Dose\u2013responses were more apparent for premenopausal \\nwomen, especially nonsmokers and those heavier or postmenopausal \\nusers  of  menopausal  hormones  (hormone  therapy  [Ht]).  Subtypes \\nof  ovarian  cancer  more  likely  to  be  associated  with  talc  included \\ninvasive serous and endometrioid tumors and borderline serous and \\nmucinous  tumors.  Premenopausal  women  and  postmenopausal  Ht \\nusers with these subtypes who had accumulated >24 talc-years had \\nOrs (95% ci) of 2.33 (1.32, 4.12) and 2.57 (1.51, 4.36), respectively.\\n\\nSubmitted 12 June 2015; accepted 17 December 2015. \\nFrom the  aObstetrics and gynecology epidemiology center, Department of \\nObstetrics and gynecology, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Boston, Ma; \\nbDepartment of epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, \\nMa; cDepartment of Pathology, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Boston, \\nMa; and dDepartment of community & Family Medicine, Department of \\nPediatrics, geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, lebanon, nH.\\n\\nSupported by the national institutes of Health (grant numbers r01ca054419, \\nP50ca105009, r01ca67272), the Department of Defense congressio-\\nnally Directed Medical research Programs (W81XWH-10-1-0280), and \\nthe  Department  of  Obstetrics  and  gynecology,  Brigham  and  Women\u2019s \\nHospital.\\n\\nDr.  cramer  reports  being  paid  for  expert  testimony  in  litigation  related  to \\novarian  cancer.

Here, we present data from \\ncombined ", " phases  of  a  case\u2013control  study  of  ovarian  cancer \\ninvolving more than 4,000 women to provide fresh perspec-\\ntives on this association.\\n\\nMETHODS\\n\\nStudy Population\\n\\nData  come  from  three  enrollment  phases:  1  (1992\u2013\\n1997), 2 (1998\u20132002), and 3 (2003\u20132008). articles we previ-\\nously published related to talc include a detailed report from \\nphase  1,7  data  from  phases  1  and  2  combined  with  nurses\u2019 \\nHealth Study data,18 and phases 1\u20133 data combined with data \\nfrom  several  participants  in  the  Ovarian  cancer association \\nconsortium (Ocac).19 this is the first detailed examination \\nof talc data from the combined phases of our study.\\n\\nDetails regarding enrollment are described elsewhere.20 \\nin brief, 3,957 women residing in eastern Massachusetts and \\nnew Hampshire diagnosed with ovarian cancer between ages \\n18 and 80 were identified through tumor boards and registries. \\n\\n334  |  www.epidem.com \\n\\nEpidemiology\u2002 \u2022\u2002 Volume\u200227,\u2002Number\u20023,\u2002May\u20022016\\n\\n\fEpidemiology\u2002 \u2022\u2002 Volume\u200227,\u2002Number\u20023,\u2002May\u20022016 \\n\\nOvarian Cancer and Talc\\n\\neight hundred and seventy-four cases were ineligible if they \\nhad died, moved outside study area, did not have a working \\ntelephone number, or had a nonovarian primary tumor. Of the \\nremaining 3,083 cases, 2,203 (71%) were enrolled. excluding \\n127  nonepithelial  and  35  mixed  mesodermal  tumors,  2,041 \\ncases  with  epithelial  tumors  of  ovarian,  primary  peritoneal, \\nand Fallopian tube origin, including borderline malignancies \\n(henceforth, epithelial ovarian cancer) were included. Pathol-\\nogy reports were reviewed and histologic subtype, grade, and \\nstage recorded. Mixed epithelial ovarian cancer was classified \\nas  the  predominant  type.  Undifferentiated,  transitional  cell, \\nfallopian tube, or primary peritoneal tumors were counted as \\nserous.21 Other mixed epithelial (n = 102), malignant Brenner \\n(n = 5), and unspecified epithelial tumors (n = 27) were clas-\\nsified as other.\\n\\ncontrols were identified through random digit dialing, \\ndriver-license lists, and town-resident lists. Between 1992 and \\n1997, 420 (72%) identified through random digit dialing and \\n102 (51%) through lists agreed to participate. From 1998 to \\n2008, 4,366 potential controls were identified using the lists, \\nof whom 1,426 (33%) were ineligible if they had died, moved, \\nor  were  seriously  ill  or  if  they  did  not  have  a  working  tele-\\nphone,  speak  english,  or  have  ovaries.  Of  eligible  controls, \\n1,362 (46%) declined to participate by phone or via \u201copt-out\u201d \\npostcard  and  1,578  (54%)  were  enrolled  (2,100  total).  con-\\ntrols were frequency matched to cases by 5-year age groups \\nand region of residence.\\n\\nExposure Assessment\\n\\nSubjects  were  personally  interviewed  about  potential \\novarian  cancer  risk  factors  that  occurred  more  than  1  year \\nbefore diagnosis, for cases, and interview, for controls. Sub-\\njects were asked whether they \u201cregularly\u201d or \u201cat least monthly\u201d \\napplied powder to the genital or rectal area, sanitary napkins \\nor tampons, underwear, or areas other than the genital-rectal \\narea. additional details included type of powder, age begun, \\nyears  used,  and  applications  per  month.  lifetime  exposure \\nwas  estimated  by  multiplying  frequency  of  applications  per \\nmonth by months used. this was divided by 360 (i.e., daily use \\ncoded as 30/month) to yield talc-years. to create categorical \\nvariables  for  talc-years,  we  chose  cut  points  based  on  quar-\\ntiles for exposed controls and rounded to the nearest integer. \\nin addition, we asked participants if their partners dusted or \\nsprayed powder to their genital or rectal areas. condom and \\ndiaphragm use as potential sources of talc exposure were also \\nrecorded.\\n\\nWe  calculated  ovulatory  cycles  by  subtracting  age  at \\nmenarche from age at last period, reduced this by time spent \\npregnant,  breastfeeding,  or  using  oral  contraceptives,  and \\ndividing the remainder by each woman\u2019s average cycle length. \\nFamily history was defined as a mother or sister with ovarian \\nor premenopausal breast cancer. Women who reported post-\\nmenopausal hormone use were classified as hormone therapy \\n(Ht)  users  and  type(s)  of  Ht  was  recorded.  Participants \\n\\ncompleted  a  food-frequency  questionnaire22  from  which \\ngrams of alcohol consumed per day were estimated.\\n\\nStatistical Methods\\n\\nUnconditional logistic regression was used to model the \\nOr and 95% ci adjusted first for matching factors (age, study \\ncenter,  and  phase)  and  then  fully  by  potential  confounders. \\nlikelihood  ratio  tests  comparing  models  with  and  without \\ninteraction  terms  were  used  to  test  for  effect  modification. \\ntests  for  trend  were  based  on  the  Wald  statistic  using  con-\\ntinuous  variables  weighted  by  category  midpoints  with  zero \\nassigned  as  the  exposure  for  nonusers.  Polytomous  logis-\\ntic ", " regression  was  used  to  simultaneously  estimate  separate \\nOrs and 95% cis for genital talc use by histologic subtypes. \\nlikelihood-ratio  tests  were  used  to  calculate  P  values  for \\nheterogeneity  by  comparing  polytomous  logistic  regression \\nmodels in which the talc association was held constant over \\ncase subgroups to models that allowed the association to dif-\\nfer between case subgroups.23 analyses were performed using \\nSaS v9.3 (SaS institute, cary, nc) and polytomous logistic \\nregression  analyses  were  performed  in  Stata  (Statacorp  lP, \\ncollege Station, tX). Sensitivity analyses to assess the influ-\\nence of exposure misclassification were performed with excel \\nusing quantitative analysis methods described previously.24\\n\\nEthical Approval\\n\\ninstitutional review boards approved the study. all par-\\n\\nticipants provided written informed consent.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\ngenital use of talc, either alone or in combination with \\nbody  use,  was  associated  with  elevated  epithelial  ovarian \\ncancer  risk  (table  1). among  women  with  no  personal  use, \\nthere was no increased risk with potential exposure from dia-\\nphragms, condoms, or partner use. therefore, only those with \\npersonal  genital  talc  exposure  were  classified  as  ever-users. \\ngenital talc use was associated with an Or (95% ci) of 1.33 \\n(1.16,  1.52)  adjusted  only  for  age,  study  center,  and  phase. \\nMost women reported using Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Baby Pow-\\nder  or  Shower  to  Shower.  Fourteen  women  who  reported \\nexclusive use of a cornstarch-based powder were considered \\nunexposed. the average age women began using talc was 20.0 \\nfor cases and 19.8 for controls. almost half of users were cur-\\nrently using or had only recently discontinued powder use at \\nthe reference date. risk decreased with increased time since \\nlast  use. the  trend  for  frequency  of  use  was  significant,  but \\nthe trend for years used was flat. Some subjects reported they \\nused  talc  only  seasonally,  but  our  original  questionnaire  did \\nnot capture this detail. a question to capture months-per-year-\\nused was added in 1998 and was available for 54% of cases \\nand 56% of controls. Year-round use was the most common \\npattern, and more cases than controls used powder year-round. \\nOrs  for  talc-years  among  those  who  reported  months-per-\\nyear-used are shown as the next-to-final entry in table 1. an \\nOr of 1.49 (95% ci = 1.06, 2.10) was associated with more \\n\\n\u00a9 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

For \\npremenopausal women, risk for eOc was increased in women \\nwho used talc before the procedure, while risk was elevated \\nfor use both before and after the procedure in postmenopausal \\nwomen who used Ht. no associations were seen in postmeno-\\npausal  women  who  had  not  used  Ht.  there  were  too  few \\nsubjects who had used talc only after a hysterectomy or tubal \\nligation to permit reliable estimates of risk.\\n\\nreturning to table 2, we applied the convention that a \\nvariable may be a confounder if adjustment yields a 10% dif-\\nference compared with the crude Or (or, in our study, com-\\npared with the Or of 1.33 adjusted for age, study center, and \\nstudy phase). a 10% lower or greater change corresponds to \\nan Or \u22641.20 or \u22651.46. as seen in the far right column, the \\nOr of 1.33 for ovarian cancer risk was not materially changed \\nafter adjustment for any individual or all variables.\\n\\nBecause Figure 2 suggests that eOc risk with talc varies \\nby menopausal status, we revisited the issue of interaction in \\netable 1 (http://links.lww.com/eDe/B2) in which subjects are \\nstratified by menopausal status. although few significant inter-\\nactions  were  seen,  categories  for  several  variables  revealed \\ncontrasting overall associations and/or clearer dose\u2013responses \\n(Fig.  3).  For  premenopausal  women,  these  included  women \\nwith a BMi > 25, those who had breastfed, those who were not \\ncurrent smokers, and those who consumed more than 2.32 g \\nof alcohol per day. in addition, the association was stronger \\n\\nfor  both  pre-  and  post-menopausal  women  who  were  least \\nlikely to have a genetic basis for their ovarian cancer, defined \\nas women with no personal history of breast cancer, without a \\nprimary relative with either ovarian cancer or premenopausal \\nbreast cancer, and non-Jewish women (etable 1; http://links.\\nlww.com/eDe/B2). no important interactions were observed \\nfor postmenopausal women, except for weight and BMi, Ht \\nuse, and the combined \u201cgenetic\u201d variable.\\n\\ntable  4  shows  Ors  stratified  by  menopausal  status \\nand histologic subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer. Overall, \\ntalc use increased risk for serous and endometrioid invasive \\nand  serous  borderline  tumors  with  the  dose\u2013response  most \\napparent  for  serous  invasive  cancer.  For  premenopausal \\nwomen,  both  the  overall  associations  and  dose\u2013responses \\nwere  stronger  with  serous  invasive  and  serous  borderline \\ntumors.  Premenopausal  women  also  had  an  increased  risk \\nfor  mucinous  borderline  tumors  at  the  highest  quartile  of \\ntalc  use  Or  =  2.2", "8  (1.23,  4.26)  and  a  dose\u2013response.  For \\npostmenopausal women, dose\u2013responses were strongest for \\nwomen with invasive serous and endometrioid tumors. talc \\nuse was not associated with clear cell or mucinous invasive \\nepithelial  ovarian  cancer  regardless  of  menopausal  status. \\nthe  Ors  and  dose\u2013responses  for  the  combined  histologic \\nsubtypes  relevant  to  pre-  and  post-menopausal  women  are \\nshown in table 5. except for a few categories, these were not \\nmaterially different than those illustrated in Figure 2.

Unfortunately, there are no external records \\nto  validate  talc  use  reported  by  study  participants  to  assess \\nwhether this degree of misclassification is reasonable. Some-\\nwhat analogous to talc and ovarian cancer is alcohol use and \\nbreast  cancer.  nurses\u2019  Health  Study  investigators  examined \\nthe latter association both with prospective data collected at \\nbaseline and retrospective data obtained by resurveying sub-\\njects after diagnosis.25 they found an (age adjusted) Or for \\nbreast  cancer  of  1.42  associated  with  30  or  more  grams  of \\nalcohol/day relative to nondrinkers from the prospective data \\ncompared with 1.33 from the retrospective data. this change \\nbetween  two  analyses  would  occur  if  the  sensitivity  of  con-\\ntrols correctly recalling alcohol use dropped to 91% (or 9% \\nmisclassification).  this  suggests  some  degree  of  misclas-\\nsification  in  retrospective  data  but  not  as  great  as  the  18% \\nrequired  to  nullify  the  association  between  use  of  talc  on \\ngenitals and ovarian cancer risk in our study. no comparable \\nstudy on talc comparing results from prospective versus ret-\\nrospective data has been performed. However, several obser-\\nvations  are  incompatible  with  the  possibility  that  recall  bias \\nexplains the association: (1) Ors are generally lower in stud-\\nies which asked about \u201cever use\u201d of talc5,8,11 compared with \\nthose  that  specified  regular  use,6,7,9,12,13  whereas  higher  Ors \\nwould  be  expected  if  cases  are  more  likely  to  recall  limited \\never-use; (2) no association with nongenital talc use; (3) risk \\nvaries by histologic type; (4) the association is stronger in pre-\\nmenopausal women who are closer in time to talc use and less \\nlikely to have forgotten it; and (5) Ors from recent studies11,13 \\nare lower than those from earlier ones,6,7 whereas increasing \\npublicity about the association over time might lead to greater \\nrecall  bias  and  higher  Ors  in  more  recent  studies.  related \\n\\narguments that cases initiate talc use because of treatment of \\novarian cancer or early symptoms of disease also lack merit \\nbecause we censored exposures 1 year before the date of diag-\\nnosis and most talc-users began the habit around age 20\u2014a \\ndecade or more before the ovarian cancer diagnosis.\\n\\nWhether the association is a result of confounding must \\nalso  be  addressed. a  1998  article  identified  BMi,  smoking, \\nand alcohol use as potential correlates of talc use in the gen-\\neral population.26 in our study, powder users were more likely \\nto be older, from more urban/suburban areas, heavier, asthma \\nsufferers, and regular analgesics users. However, none of these \\nor  other table  2  variables  altered  the  overall  association  by \\nmore than 10", "%, providing no indication of confounding. talc \\nuse was also greater in african americans and notably associ-\\nated with a high, albeit imprecise, Or (and 95% ci) of 5.08 \\n(1.32, 19.6). this finding clearly requires further study.\\n\\nthe  observation  that  talc  users,  both  case  and  control \\nsubjects, were more likely to say they had asthma has not been \\npreviously reported. the link between powder use and asthma \\nmay not be fully appreciated from table 2 since women who \\nused  talc  as  a  body  powder  but  not  to  the  genital  area  were \\nclassified as nonexposed. Making no body or genital exposure \\nthe nonexposed referent group and asthma the outcome, the \\nOrs  (and  95%  ci)  for  asthma  for  body  exposure  to  talc  is \\n1.27 (0.80, 2.03) for cases and 1.02 (0.66, 1.57) for controls. \\nthe  comparable  Or  for  genital  use  of  talc  with  or  without \\nbody use is 1.48 (1.00, 2.18) for cases and 1.45 (1.00, 2.10) \\nfor controls. Sixty of 85 cases (70%) with asthma and 57 of 89 \\n(64%) controls reported that talc use predated asthma onset. \\nalthough  chance  must  be  considered  a  possible  explanation \\nfor this novel finding, talc is a cause of occupational asthma27 \\nand  respiratory  distress  has  been  reported  in  infants  after \\ntalc  was  accidentally  inhaled.28 that  asthma  may  be  associ-\\nated with use of talc is important not only because of health \\n\\n\u00a9 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Overall,  the \\nassociation was greater in women with no personal history of \\nbreast cancer, those who had a tubal ligation or hysterectomy, \\nin  premenopausal  women,  and  postmenopausal  women  who \\nhad used Ht. among these factors, perhaps the most impor-\\ntant  is  effect  modification  of  the  association  by  menopausal \\nstatus and menopausal Ht.\\n\\napparent  lack  of  an  elevated  risk  for  epithelial  ovar-\\nian  cancer  from  talc  use  in  postmenopausal  women  without \\nHt use has not been reported previously. explanations might \\ninclude that there is no association with talc use in the absence \\nof endogenous or exogenous estrogen, fading memory of past \\nexposures,  women  who  will  develop  ovarian  cancer  from \\ntalc use leave the at risk pool before they reach menopause, \\nor  more  complex  interactions  with  multiple  risk  factors  and \\ngene\u2013environment interactions. Of possible relevance, Moor-\\nman  et  al.29  observed  that  reproductive  events  that  clearly \\naffect risk in premenopausal women may not affect risk to the \\nsame degree in postmenopausal women. Whatever the expla-\\nnation, our observation challenges the relevance of the WHi \\nstudy  to  the  ovarian  cancer/talc  association  since  only  post-\\nmenopausal  women  were  enrolled  in WHi  and  Ht  use  was \\nexamined only as a confounder, not an effect modifier.16 Fur-\\nther study will be necessary to clarify the role that talc may \\nplay  in  postmenopausal  women  who  did  not  use  Ht  with  a \\nfocus on those factors that may increase endogenous estrogen, \\nsuch as greater BMi.\\n\\nthat the association is more apparent in premenopausal \\nwomen  and  in  postmenopausal  women  who  used  hormonal \\ntherapy suggests that estrogen plays a role in the association. \\nin  talc  inhalation  studies  conducted  by  the  national  toxi-\\ncology  Program,  only  female  rats  developed  lung  tumors.30 \\nliterature  on  airway  inflammation  from  particulates  is  also \\nrelevant. citing evidence that asthma may be exacerbated dur-\\ning pregnancy, Zhang et al.31 postulated this may be due to an \\neffect of estrogen on macrophage activity and inflammatory \\nresponse  to  particulates  normally  considered  inert,  like  tita-\\nnium dioxide (tiO2). their in-vivo studies demonstrated that \\nmacrophages from pregnant mice transplanted to nonpregnant \\nrecipients conferred an inflammatory phenotype in response \\nto tiO2.  Such  studies  should  be  repeated  with  talc,  another \\nparticulate considered \u201cinert.\u201d\\n\\nan exploratory analysis of other potential effect modi-\\nfiers led to several other observations that may have biologic \\nrelevance. the overall associations and dose\u2013responses were \\n\u201cstronger\u201d for premenopausal women who had a greater BMi, \\nhad breastfed, were not current smokers, and consumed alco-\\nhol (Fig. 3). Due to the large number of associations tested, \\nchance  must  be  the  first  explanation  considered.  However, \\n\\na  common  denominator  could  be  prolactin  since  its  levels \\nare  higher  in  women  who  h", "ave  greater  BMi,32  breastfed,33 \\ndo  not  currently  smoke,34  consume  alcohol,35  and  are  post-\\nmenopausal and use Ht.36 like estrogen, prolactin may have \\nmultiple  effects  on  immune  cells,  especially  monocytes  and \\nmacrophages37  whose  role  in  scavenging  talc  in  tissue  is \\ndescribed.38 these observations provide a framework for talc \\ncarcinogenicity in eOc involving chronic inflammation.9\\n\\nBiologic  credibility  of  the  talc/eOc  association  is \\nenhanced by persuasive evidence that inert particles the size \\nof talc, present in the vagina, can migrate to the upper geni-\\ntal  tract.  in  a  technique  called  hysterosalpingoscintigraphy, \\ntechnetium-labeled  albumen  microspheres  are  placed  in  the \\nvagina and their migration to the upper tract was confirmed \\nusing serial scintograms.39 the microspheres are 5 to 40 \u03bcm \\nin  diameter\u2014a  range  which  includes  the  size  of  sperm  and \\ntalc. Migration from the vagina is the obvious explanation for \\nwhy  talc  can  be  found  in  diseased  (and  some  normal)  ova-\\nries.3  Unfortunately,  no  epidemiologic  study  of  epithelial \\novarian cancer and talc has taken the opportunity to determine \\nwhether talc can actually be found in tissues removed at sur-\\ngery and correlated with exposure to talc. a clue to talc\u2019s pres-\\nence is birefringent particles found when slides are examined \\nunder polarized-light microscopy. although confirmation that \\nthe material is actually talc requires scanning electron micros-\\ncopy  and  X-ray  dispersion  spectroscopy,  presence  of  bire-\\nfringence is a practical screening technique as illustrated by \\na case report of a woman with ovarian cancer and long-term \\ntalc use who had talc in her pelvic lymph nodes first suggested \\nby birefringence.40\\n\\nthere  are  inherent  limitations  quantifying  a  dose\u2013\\nresponse due to a lack of metrics for how much talc is in an \\n\u201capplication,\u201d  how  much  enters  the  vagina,  and  how  much \\nreaches the upper genital tract where, presumably, any delete-\\nrious effect is mediated. this may account for the failure to \\nidentify a dose\u2013response in many papers on talc and ovarian \\ncancer. Our 1999 study7 suggested that adjusting total applica-\\ntions by whether the genital tract was \u201copen\u201d (i.e., excluding \\nuse after a tubal ligation or hysterectomy and examining use \\nduring times when ovulation was occurring) yielded signifi-\\ncant dose\u2013responses. Mills et al.10 found a dose\u2013response by \\nfrequency of use. Wu et al.,12 looking at all types of body use, \\nfound  a  dose\u2013response  with  estimated  applications.  Merritt \\net al.11 reported a significant trend in risk for invasive serous \\novarian cancer with years of talc use. the recent Ocac analy-\\nsis  reported  no  trend  with  increasing  lifetime  applications \\nwhen  restricted  to  talc  users.19  However,  an  increase  in  risk \\nwith increasing applications was found for nonmucinous epi-\\nthelial ovarian cancer when nonusers were included. Virtually \\nall papers that have looked at dose\u2013response for talc and epi-\\nthelial ovarian cancer risk have included nonusers in the trend \\nanalysis. in our article, we calculated talc-years and showed \\nthat, overall, there is a significant trend for epithelial ovarian \\ncancer risk and talc-years when nonusers are included, and the \\n\\n344  |  www.epidem.com \\n\\n\u00a9 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Menstrual characteristics, reproductive and contraceptive history\\nand history of exposure to various environmental factors were compared between 235 women with his-\\ntologically diagnosed epithelial ovarian cancer and 451 controls. High gravidity, hysterectomy, female sterilisa-\\ntion and oral contraceptive use were associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer. Infertility and late age\\nat menopause were associated with an increase in risk. While these factors were related, they were each found\\nto be independently associated with ovarian cancer risk after adjusting for the effect of the other factors.\\n\\nWhile results from recent case -control studies have con-\\nsistently shown that multiparity and oral contraceptive use\\nare associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer, the\\nassociation of the cancer with other reproductive, hormonal\\nand related factors such as age at menopause, history of\\nhysterectomy or use of oestrogen replacement therapy is less\\nclear. We have conducted a hospital-based case-control\\nstudy in London and Oxford which was designed to inves-\\ntigate the independent contributions of reproductive history\\nand contraceptive use to ovarian cancer risk. In particular, it\\nwas planned to attempt to segregate out the effect on risk of\\ninfertility from that of voluntary limitation of family size.\\nThe association between ovarian cancer and other possible\\naetiological agents was also examined.\\n\\nSubjects and methods\\n\\noral\\n\\nBetween October 1978 and February 1983 five interviewers\\nidentified and questioned women with a diagnosis of ovarian\\ncancer and women selected as controls at 13 hospitals in\\nLondon and two in Oxford. A standard questionnaire was\\nused to obtain information on reproductive and menstrual\\nhistory and on exposure to various substances such as\\nexogenous oestrogens, cigarettes and talc. A month by month\\nrecord was made of the specific contraceptive methods used\\nby each woman between the ages of 16 and 45 years, or, if\\nunder 45 years, up to the time of diagnosis (cases) or inter-\\nview (controls). The methods were classified as sheaths,\\ndiaphragms,\\ndevices,\\nor\\n'other methods' (spermicides, rhythm and coitus interruptus).\\nWomen who reported using a contraceptive diaphragm were\\nasked if they had stored it in talc. Also recorded were\\nmonths during which a woman was not using contraception\\ndue to sexual abstinence, pregnancy, menopause or because\\nshe or her partner had been sterilised. The other months\\nwhen a woman reported using no method of contraception\\nalthough sexually active have been classified as months of\\n'unprotected intercourse'. The total duration of use of each\\ncontraceptive method, of any contraceptive method, of unp-\\nrotected intercourse and of pregnancy were computed for\\neach woman.\\n\\ncontraceptives\\n\\nintrauterine\\n\\nThe study was confinied to women aged less than 65 years\\nwhose diagnosis of ovarian cancer had been made within two\\nyears of interview. A total of 280 cases were interviewed and\\npathological specimens were histologically classified by Pro-\\nfessor C. Hudson and Dr M. Curling from St Bartholomews\\nHospital. A total of 235 women with epithelial ovarian\\ncancer were included in the analyses. For these women, the\\ntumour type was described as serous in 101 (43%) cases,\\nmucinous in 38 (15%) cases, endometrioid in 52 (22%) cases\\n\\nCorrespondence: M. Booth.\\nReceived 3 February 1989; and in revised form 9 May 1989.\\n\\nand clear cell in 12 (5%) cases. Mixed and undifferentiated\\ntypes of epithelial tumours accounted for the remaining 32\\n(14%) cases. Excluded from the analyses were nine women\\nwith a non-epithelial ovarian neoplasm, 11 with a primary\\ntumour in an unknown site outside the ovary, 21 with a\\nprimary tumour in an unknown site although one consistent\\nwith an ovarian origin, one with a benign tumour and three\\nfor whom pathology material could not be obtained.\\n\\nFor each case it was planned to select two age-matched\\ncontrols from women being treated in the same hospital.\\nWomen with bilateral oophorectomy were excluded from the\\ncontrol group as were women admitted with conditions that\\nhave been related to reproductive history or oral contracep-\\ntive use (all circulatory and gynaecological diseases, gallblad-\\", "nder and thyroid diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, malignant\\ndisease of the breast, uterus and bladder, and melanoma).\\nIt proved logistically impossible to select two age-matched\\ncontrols for each case from the same hospital and it was\\ndecided merely to ensure that the age distribution of the\\ncontrols was approximately the same as that of the cases.\\nFor 63 cases recruited from a London hospital where only\\ncancer patients are treated, controls were selected from other\\nLondon hospitals. For these reasons, the data were analysed\\nusing an unmatched approach with adjustments being made\\nto relative risk estimates for age and socio-economic status.\\nA total of 451 controls have been included in the analyses.\\nThe admission diagnoses for these patients were gastrointes-\\ntinal disease (105), bone or joint disease (70), respiratory\\ndisease (39), renal or other urinary disease (35), neurological\\ndisease (30), fractures or other injuries (28), skin or sub-\\ncutaneous tissue disease (17), malignant neoplasms of the\\ndigestive organs (15) and bone or skin (2), benign neoplasms\\nof the digestive organs (4) respiratory system (4) and other\\nsites (8) and various other conditions and symptoms (94).\\nThis final category included patients with haemorrhoids (15)\\nand those with symptoms relating to the respiratory system\\n(10), gastrointestinal tract (20) and urinary system (10).\\n\\nMaximum likelihood\\n\\nestimates of relative\\n\\nrisk (RR)\\ntogether with their 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and\\ntests for trend where appropriate were computed by multiple\\nlogistic regression techniques (Breslow & Day, 1980) using\\nthe GLIM statistical package (Baker & Nelder, 1978). All\\nrelative risks have been adjusted for age in 5-year strata\\n(20-24, 25-29, .\\n. 60-64) and for social class in six\\ncategories (1,II,JII non-manual, III manual, IV and V). Age\\nof the cases was taken as age at diagnosis of ovarian cancer\\nand of the controls as age at interview. Social class was based\\non occupation (Office of Population Censuses and Surveys,\\n1970) using husband's occupation for ever married women\\nand own occupation for those who had never married. Other\\nrelative risk adjustments and tests for trend have been made\\nwith the exposures as continuous variables. When the data\\nwere examined by place of interview (London or Oxford),\\nin the risk estimates\\nthere were no notable differences\\n\\n.\\n\\n\fassociated with the major variables of interest. The relative\\nrisks have not, therefore, been stratified by place of interview.\\nThe terms nulligravid and gravid have been used to denote,\\nrespectively, women who have never knowingly conceived\\nand women who have had at least one pregnancy. Parity has\\nbeen defined as number of live and still births.\\n\\nResults\\n\\n(X2\\n\\nrisk\\n\\nthan\\n\\ncancer\\n\\nhigher\\n\\nof ovarian\\n\\nThe age distributions of the cases and controls are shown in\\nTable I. The average age of the cases was slightly higher than\\nthat of the controls. There was an excess of cases in social\\nII, and III non-manual (58%) as compared to\\nclasses I,\\ncontrols (43%) (P = 0.05) and, because of this, all relative\\nrisks have been adjusted for social class as well as age. Table\\nII shows the relative risks for ovarian cancer associated with\\nvarious aspects of pregnancy history. Nulligravid women had\\ngravid women\\na\\n(RR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.6). The relative risks were elevated\\nboth in nulligravid women who had been sexually active and\\nin those who had not, although significantly so only for the\\nsexually active. Among those who had ever been pregnant,\\nthe relative risks decreased as the number of pregnancies\\nincreased,\\n(trend) = 4.3, P <0.05). Similarly, among\\nparous women, the higher the parity the lower the relative\\nrisks (X2 (trend) = 3.9, P <0.05). After adjusting for parity,\\nthe\\nassociated with successive numbers of\\nincomplete pregnancies (spontaneous and induced abortions)\\nalso decreased although the\\nstatistically\\nsignificant (X2 (trend) = 0.5). Women having their first preg-\\nnancy after the age of 35 years had a significantly higher risk\\nof ovarian cancer than women with a first pregnancy before\\nthe age of 20 years. Their risk was also higher than that for\\nnulligravid women. There was, however, no marked nor\\nsignificant trend of increasing risk the later the age at first\\npregnancy (X2 (trend) = 1.0). Analyses by age at first livebirth\\ngave similar findings. After adjustment for number of livebir-\\nths, women who had breastfed for more than two years in\\ntotal had over three times the risk of ovarian cancer com-\\npared to women who had never breastfed (P < 0.05) but\\noverall, there was no significant trend the longer the duration\\nof lactation.\\n\\ntrend was not\\n\\nrelative\\n\\nrisks\\n\\nAnalyses of infertility and subfertility as risk factors for\\novarian cancer were restricted to the 213 (91 %) cases and 240\\n(93%) controls who reported that they had ever been sexually\\nactive. Among these women, 30 (14%) w", "ith ovarian cancer and\\n34 (8%) controls reported, when so questioned, that they had\\nhad problems in becoming pregnant and, of these, 16 cases and\\n12 controls had never conceived. Analysis of the data on\\ncontraceptive use suggested that there were other women who\\nmight have been infertile or subfertile. Although sexually active,\\nthey had used contraception infrequently or not at all and had\\nhad few or no pregnancies. For all women who had ever been\\nsexually active, the risk of ovarian cancer increased with\\nincreasing duration of unprotected intercourse after adjustment\\nfor gravidity (X2 (trend) = 10.2, P <0.01). The effect was most\\nmarked among nulligravid women who reported more than 10\\nyears of unprotected intercourse. Their risk was over six times\\nthat of nulligravid women who reported less than three months\\nof unprotected intercourse (Table III). Among gravid women,\\nthose reporting over 10 years of unprotected intercourse had a\\nhigher risk than other gravid women. There was no significant\\ntrend in risk associated with the duration of use of any\\n\\nTable I Age distribution and average age of cases and controls\\n\\nAge (years)\\n20-34\\n35-44\\n45-54\\n55-64\\nTotal\\nAverage age (years)\\n\\nCases (%)\\n13 (5.5)\\n27 (11.5)\\n87 (37.0)\\n108 (46.0)\\n235\\n52.4\\n\\nControls (%)\\n33 (7.3)\\n75 (16.6)\\n156 (34.6)\\n187 (41.5)\\n451\\n51.4\\n\\nRISK FACTORS FOR OVARIAN CANCER\\n\\n593\\n\\nTable II\\n\\nRelative risks for ovarian cancer associated with pregnancy\\n\\nhistory\\n\\nVariable\\nGravidityb\\nGravid\\nNulligravid\\n\\nNulligravid and ever\\nsexually active\\nNulligravid and never\\nsexually active\\nNumber of pregnancies\\n\\n0\\n\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n\\nCases\\n\\nControls\\n\\nRR\\n\\n(95% CI)\\n\\n176\\n59\\n\\n376\\n74\\n\\n1.Oa\\n1.7\\n\\n(1.1 -2.6)\\n\\n37\\n\\n22\\n\\n59\\n\\n43\\n\\n63\\n\\n37\\n\\n13\\n\\n20\\n\\n44\\n\\n1.9\\n\\n(1.1-3.1)\\n\\n30\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n(0.8-2.6)\\n\\n74\\n\\n71\\n\\n107\\n\\n98\\n\\n41\\n\\n59\\n\\n1.Oa\\n\\n0.8\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n(0.4-1.3)\\n\\n(0.4-1.1)\\n\\n(0.3-0.8)\\n\\n(0.2-0.8)\\n\\n(0.2-0.8)\\n\\nx2 for trend = 4.3 P<0.05\\n(gravid women only)\\n\\nEstimated reduction in relative\\nassociated with each pregnancq\\n\\nrisk\\n\\ny\\n\\n0.86\\n\\n(0.78-0.94)\\n\\nParityb\\n0\\n\\n2\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n66\\n48\\n61\\n40\\n12\\n\\n8\\n\\n87\\n\\n84\\n\\n127\\n\\n88\\n30\\n\\n34\\n\\nI.Oa\\n0.7\\n\\n0.6\\n\\n0.6\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n0.3\\n\\n(0.4-\\n(0.4-\\n(0.3-\\n(0.2-\\n(0.1-\\n\\n1.2)\\n1.0)\\n-1.0)\\n1.0)\\n-0.7)\\n\\nx2 for trend = 3.9 P<0.05\\n(parous women only)\\n\\nEstimated reduction in relative risk\\nassociated with each birth\\nNo. of incomplete preg-\\nnanciesb.c\\n\\n0.84\\n\\n(0.75-0.94)\\n\\n0\\n\\n2\\n\\n330\\n\\n83\\n\\n18\\n\\n19\\n\\n185\\n\\n39\\n\\n7\\n\\n4\\n\\nX2\\n\\nl .02\\n0.9\\n0.7\\n0.6\\n= 0.5\\n\\n(0.6-\\n(0.3-\\n(0.2-\\n\\n-1.4)\\n-1.8)\\n-1.7)\\n\\n0.92\\n\\n(0.75- 1.13)\\n\\nEstimated reduction in relative\\nrisk associated with each incomplete pregnancy\\nAge at first pregnancy\\n(years)d\\n\\n15- 19\\n20 -24\\n25 -29\\n30-34\\n35\\n\\nNulligravid\\n\\nMonths of lactatione\\nNone\\n\\n<6\\n7-12\\n13- 18\\n19-24\\n,25\\n\\n26\\n73\\n49\\n17\\n9\\n59\\nx2 for trend =\\n\\n65\\n\\n1.02\\n\\n182\\n0.9\\n96\\n1.2\\n1.2\\n29\\n4.1\\n4\\n2.0\\n74\\n1.0 (gravid women only)\\n\\n(0.5- 1.5)\\n(0.7-2.2)\\n(0.8-2.7)\\n(1.1 -15.1)\\n(1.1 -3.7)\\n\\n44\\n66\\n29\\n13\\n5\\n12\\n\\n107\\n124\\n80\\n29\\n7\\n15\\n\\n1.0o\\n1.3\\n0.9\\n1.2\\n2.1\\n3.4\\nx2 for trend = 1.8\\n\\n(0.8-\\n(0.5-\\n(0.5-\\n(0.7-\\n(1.1\\n\\n-2.2)\\n-1.6)\\n-2.5)\\n-6.7)\\n-10.8)\\n\\nb\\n\\nAll relative risks adjusted for age and social class.

There was no trend in\\nrisk with age at menarche (X2 (trend) = 0.03). In contrast, risk\\nincreased the later the age at natural menopause (X2 (trend) =\\n7. 1, P < 0.01). Women having their menopause at the age of 50\\nyears or later had nearly three times the risk of women who were\\nmenopausal before the age of 45 years. The risks and trend\\nassociated with age at menopause were similar irrespective of\\nwhether they were adjusted for age in five year or one year strata.\\n\\nTable IV\\n\\nRelative risks for ovarian cancer associated with duration of\\n\\nuse of contraception by gravidity\\n\\nTable VI\\n\\nRelative risks for ovarian cancer associated with oral\\n\\ncontraceptive (OC) use\\n\\nCases\\n\\nControls\\n\\nRR (95% CI)\\n\\nCases\\n\\nControls\\n\\nRR (95% CI)\\n\\nNulligravid women\\nDuration of use of con-\\ntraception\\n\\nNever used\\n< 10 years\\n10-20 years\\n> 20 years\\n\\n15\\n14\\n6\\n2\\n\\nX2 for trend = 0.9\\n\\nGravid women\\nDuration of use of con-\\ntraception\\n\\nNever used\\n< 10 years\\n10 -20 years\\n> 20 years\\n\\n32\\n25\\n55\\n64\\n\\n10\\n21\\n9\\n4\\n\\n47\\n56\\n147\\n126\\n\\n1.0\\\"\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.4\\n\\n0.4\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n\\n(0.1 -1.7)\\n(0.1-2.5)\\n(0.1 -3.2)\\n\\n(0.2-1.1)\\n(0.

We also found that the greater the\\nnumber of incomplete pregnancies the lower the\\nrisk,\\nalthough the trend was not significant. Most other studies\\nhave not investigated if women of low gravidity have an\\nincreased risk of ovarian cancer because of reduced fertility\\nor because of voluntary limitation of family size, although\\nJoly et al. (1974), McGowan et al. (1979) and Nasca et al.\\n(1984) found a higher risk in women who had tried to\\nconceive but had failed. Our findings also suggest that infer-\\ntility is a risk factor for ovarian cancer. Women who had not\\nconceived but had been sexually active for more than 10\\nyears without using contraception had about six times the\\nrisk of all other women. Approximately half these women\\nhad undergone investigations for infertility. For only five\\ncases and one control was the cause of their infertility deter-\\nmined. Thus, it is not possible to assess whether this high risk\\ngroup had normal or impaired ovarian function. Subfertility\\nmay also be associated with ovarian cancer. Gravid women\\nreporting over 10 years of unprotected intercourse had a\\n50% higher risk than other gravid women, but this increase\\nwas not statistically significant.\\n\\nAge at first pregnancy was not found to be associated with\\novarian cancer risk although women having a first pregnancy\\nafter the age of 35 years had a higher risk compared to\\nwomen having a first pregnancy at earlier ages and to nullig-\\nravid women. Since subfertility might be a risk factor for\\novarian cancer, the relative risks associated with age at first\\npregnancy were also adjusted for duration of unprotected\\nintercourse. The raised risk for women ", "with a first pregnancy\\nafter 35 years persisted (RR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.1- 14.2). Results\\nfrom other studies regarding the risk for women having a\\nfirst child at relatively older ages are inconclusive, some\\nfinding no association (Newhouse et al., 1977; Casagrande et\\nal., 1979; Cramer et al., 1983; Lesher et al., 1985), others an\\nincreased risk (Joly et al.,\\n1979;\\nHildreth et al., 1981; Franceschi et al., 1982). Only Frances-\\nchi et al. (1982) found the increased risk to be statistically\\nsignificant and independent of parity.\\n\\n1974; McGowan et al.,\\n\\nOverall, there was no association between use of any con-\\ntraception and ovarian cancer. Of the specific methods\\nstudied, female sterilisation and use of oral contraception\\nwere associated with a significant reduction in risk and no\\nmethod was associated with a significant increase in risk. The\\nassociations remained after adjusting for gravidity and dur-\\nation of unprotected intercourse,\\nthe measure used to\\nindicate infertility. While few studies have examined the\\nassociation between female sterilisation and ovarian cancer,\\nthe relation between oral contraceptives and ovarian cancer\\nhas been demonstrated in many studies (Booth & Beral,\\n1985). Like others, we demonstrated that the longer oral\\ncontraceptives had been used, the lower the risk. Our findings\\nalso suggested that the earlier the age at first use the lower\\nthe risk and that the protective effect of oral contraceptives\\npersists after their use is stopped.\\n\\nIt has been suggested that inhibition of ovulation, as\\ninduced by pregnancy and oral contraceptives, is the factor\\nwhich protects against ovarian cancer (Fathalla, 1971). If so,\\npostpartum anovulation associated with lactation might also\\nbe expected to be protective. We found no evidence that the\\nlonger a woman had breastfed the lower her risk of ovarian\\ncancer. Indeed, the highest risk was found in those who had\\nbreastfed longest. Results from other studies are contradic-\\n\\n\ftory (Cramer et al., 1983; Mori et al., 1984; Risch et al.,\\n1983; Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study, 1987).\\n\\nOur finding that age at menarche was not associated with\\nrisk is consistent with results from most other studies (Casa-\\ngrande et al., 1979; McGowan et al., 1979; Hildreth et al.,\\n1981; Franceschi et al., 1982). Age at natural menopause,\\nhowever, was strongly related to risk. While Hildreth et al.\\n(1981), Franceschi et al. (1982) and Tzonou et al. (1984) also\\ndemonstrated that the later the age at menopause the greater\\nthe risk, other studies have found no association (West, 1966;\\nNewhouse et al., 1977; Annegers et al., 1979; McGowan et\\nal., 1979; Cramer et al., 1983).\\n\\nA lower frequency of hysterectomy, of unilateral oophorec-\\ntomy, or of both among cases compared to controls has also\\nbeen reported from several other studies (Wynder et al.,\\n1969; Joly et al., 1974; Annegers et al., 1979; McGowan et\\nal., 1979; Franceschi et al., 1982; Cramer et al., 1983). As\\nthese studies were case-control in design, there may have\\nbeen some misclassification of controls who, rather than\\nhaving a hysterectomy with ovarian conservation, actually\\nhad a hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy. Another\\nexplanation for the findings might be that if at hysterectomy\\na woman's ovaries look diseased, it is likely that they are\\nremoved. If the diseased ovaries were precancerous, those\\nwomen who might otherwise have developed ovarian cancer\\ndo not. Following hysterectomy with ovarian conservation,\\nreduced ovarian function or ovarian failure occurs in a pro-\\nportion of women, due possibly to the blood supply to the\\novaries being compromised (Beavis et al., 1969; Ellsworth et\\nal., 1983). Female sterilisation was also associated with a low\\nrisk of ovarian cancer. Neil et al. (1975) have suggested that\\nthe menstrual disturbance that many women experience after\\nsterilisation may reflect changed ovarian function due to\\ndamage to the vascular supply to the ovaries.\\nIf both\\nhysterectomy and female sterilisation can indirectly affect\\novarian function then both procedures could also influence\\nthe risk of ovarian cancer.\\n\\nRecent investigators have shown that the longer a woman\\novulates the greater her risk of ovarian cancer (Casagrande et\\nal., 1979; Hildreth et al., 1981; Franceschi et al., 1982; Wu et al.,\\n1988). We also found that risk increased the longer the duration\\nof ovulation. Duration of ovulation is, however, highly cor-\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nRISK FACTORS FOR OVARIAN CANCER\\n\\n597\\n\\nrelated with the 'anovulatory' factors used to estimate the\\nexposure. In an attempt to determine whether duration of\\novulation had an effect over and above that expressed by its\\nrelation with these factors, the risks and trends were adjusted for\\nduration of anovulation due to pregnancy and oral contracep-\\ntive use and, where appropriate, for age at menopause. The\\nsignificance of the effect disappeared. We conclude that it is not\\npossible to", " determine from these data whether it is the above\\nfactors which inhibit ovulation that prevent ovarian cancer,\\nwhether repeated ovulations promote it, or whether a combina-\\ntion of both is acting.\\n\\nOur finding of no overall relationship between hormone\\nreplacement therapy and ovarian cancer supports those of other\\ninvestigators (Newhouse et al., 1977; Hildreth et al., 1981; Weiss\\net al., 1982). An increased risk associated with the therapy was\\nfound among women who reported hysterectomy, but the\\nfinding was based on very few cases and may have been due to\\nchance. We did not find an increased risk associated with\\noestrogen therapy for any particular tumour types as suggested\\nby Cramer et al. (1981) and Weiss et al. (1982).\\n\\nThe evidence linking talc with ovarian cancer is controversial\\n(Anonymous, 1977; Roe, 1979; Longo & Young 1979; Cramer\\net al., 1982; Hartge et al., 1983). In this study, women who\\nreported talc use in the genital area more than once a week or\\ndaily had higher risks of ovarian cancer than women who used\\ntalc less frequently. The women were not asked how long they\\nhad been using talc. It is possible that because of their symptoms\\nor disease-related pelvic examinations, the frequency of current\\ntalc use by the cases may not have reflected their frequency of\\npast use. Since these and other results (Cramer et al., 1982;\\nHartge et al., 1983) are insufficient to reject an association,\\nfurther work is needed on the relation between genital use of talc\\nand ovarian cancer.\\n\\nWe would like to thank the Imperial Cancer Research Fund for\\nfinancing the study, Professor Sir Richard Doll for helpful advice,\\nProfessor Christopher Hudson and Dr Marigold Curling for reviewing\\nthe histology, Dr Eve Wiltshaw, the consultants, nurses and other staff\\nof the participating hospitals for their co-operation and support of the\\nstudy, Ann Bateman, Kate Rodriques, Gillian Saunders and Rosalie\\nThomson for their skilful interviewing, and Nina Saroi for typing the\\nmanuscript.

Prior systematic reviews focused on ever use.\\nThe purpose of this study is to estimate the association\\nbetween frequent (at least 2 times per week) perineal tal-\\ncum powder use and ovarian cancer.\\nMETHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was\\nconducted according to meta-analysis of observational\\nstudies in epidemiology guidelines. Study protocol was\\nprospectively registered at PROSPERO (registration num-\\nber CRD42020172720). Searches were performed in\\nPubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central\\nRegister of Controlled Trials databases from their incep-\\ntion to August 2, 2021. Case-control and cohort studies\\nwere included if they reported frequent perineal talcum\\npowder use and an adjusted odds ratio or hazard ratio for\\novarian cancer. Review for inclusion, data extraction, and\\nquality assessment (using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale\\n[NOS]) were performed independently by two reviewers.\\nPooled adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals\\nwere generated from the random effects model.

Publication quality was high (median\\nNOS = 8, range: 4 to 9). Frequent talcum powder use was\\nassociated with an elevated risk of ovarian cancer (adjust-\\ned pooled summary odds ratio 1.47 (95% CI 1.31, 1.65,\\nP<0.0001). There was no evidence of bias and low hetero-\\ngeneity (I2= 24%, P=0.22). There was no meaningful dif-\\nference limiting analysis to publications with a NOS qual-\\nity score of 8 or 9 or limiting studies based on study\\ndesign.\\nCONCLUSIONS: This review suggests an increased risk of\\novarian cancer associated with frequent perineal powder\\nexposure of 31\u201365%.\\n\\nReceived September 14, 2021\\nAccepted January 13, 2022\\nPublished online February 2, 2022\\n\\n2526\\n\\nKEY WORDS: talcum powder; ovarian neoplasm; women\u2019s health; meta-\\nanalysis.\\n\\nJ Gen Intern Med 37(10):2526\u201332\\nDOI: 10.1007/s11606-022-07414-7\\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nTalc, the primary ingredient in baby powder, is a naturally\\noccurring mineral known for its softness and absorbency and\\nhas been added to a broad range of personal care products\\nsince the early part of the twentieth century. To date, there\\nhave been seven systematic reviews and pooled data studies1\u20137\\nof the relationship between talcum powder products and ovar-\\nian cancer. All studies including retrospective case-control\\nstudies have found a positive association.2\u20137 The most recent\\nreview by O\u2019Brien1 limited analysis to the four prospective\\ncohort studies and in its main conclusion stated there was no\\nstatistically significant association between genital talc use\\nand ovarian cancer.\\n\\nThe differences in conclusions between the metanalyses are\\nat least partially due to the inconsistent talcum-based powder\\nexposure questions regarding the frequency and type of expo-\\nsure. To harmonize the exposure measurements across the\\ngreatest number of studies, prior meta-analyses primarily fo-\\ncused on quantifying the association between ever versus\\nnever use of talcum powder products and ovarian cancer.\\nHowever, ever use is a non-specific exposure that could dilute\\nor obscure a meaningful association as ever use would com-\\nbine women with low and high exposures to talcum powder.\\nKnowledge of ovarian cancer risks are important for wom-\\nen\u2019s health and important to guide regulatory oversight. The\\npurpose of this analysis is to estimate the risk of ovarian cancer\\nassociated with the frequent use of talcum powder products.\\nWe hypothesize that assessment of ovarian cancer risk among\\nfrequent users of talcum powder products would provide a\\nmore meaningful assessment of its carcinogenicity.\\n\\n\fJGIM\\n\\nWoolen et ", "al.: Use of Frequent Perineal Talcum Powder and Ovarian Cancer\\n\\n2527\\n\\nMETHODS\\n\\nWe conducted a systematic review of the literature and meta-\\nanalysis to assess the association between the frequent perineal\\nexposure to talc and ovarian cancer following the Meta-\\nanalyses of Observational studies (MOOSE) reporting guide-\\nlines. A study protocol was developed in advance and regis-\\ntered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic\\nReviews (PROSPERO) on April 28, 2020 (registration num-\\nber: CRD42020172720).\\n\\nSearch Strategy and Information Sources\\n\\nComprehensive searches were performed by an expert health\\nscience informationist from inception of the relevant databases\\nto August 2, 2021. Searches were completed in the following:\\nPubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central\\nRegister of Controlled Trials. Each search consisted of talcum\\npowder and ovarian cancer concept blocks, which can be\\nviewed in the supplemental material. No date, language, or\\nother restrictions were incorporated into the searches. Dupli-\\ncate citations were removed in Endnote X9.3.1 (Clarivate\\nAnalytics). The references of all publications were searched\\nto identify additional publications.\\n\\nEligibility Criteria and Study Selection\\n\\nSelection of studies included observational cohort and case-\\ncontrol study designs. Studies were included if they reported\\nprimary data on frequent, defined as multiple (2 or more) times\\nper week perineal exposure to talc, and reported an adjusted\\nodds ratio or hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) for\\novarian malignancy. Other uses of talcum powder, including\\napplications to the body, were excluded to isolate exposure\\nmechanism to perineal application. Conference abstracts,\\nretracted manuscripts, narrative reviews, editorials, case\\nreports, and manuscripts not reporting the location or frequen-\\ncy of talcum powder application were excluded.\\n\\nStudies were screened for inclusion using prespecified se-\\nlection criteria by a single author (SW). Selection criteria\\nincluded publication of primary data, reporting on multiple\\ntimes per week (\u2265 2 times per week) perineal exposure to\\ntalcum powder including direct application of talcum powder\\nto the perineum and rectum, application to underwear or\\nsanitary napkins, or on birth control devices like diaphragms\\nand risk for ovarian malignancy. Studies were also selected for\\nbaseline quality requiring a multivariable risk adjustment,\\nstudy size (n>10 cancers), and defined research methods to\\nallow assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria (flow\\ndiagram Fig. 1). The search resulted in 761 citations, which\\nwere screened at the title and abstract level by a single author\\n(SW). The full manuscripts of relevant citations (n=52) were\\nindependently reviewed by two authors (SW and RSB).\\nAgreement for inclusion was calculated using the Cohen k\\nwith the following scale: 0.01 to 0.20 indicates slight; 0.21 to\\n0.40, fair; 0.41 to 0.60, moderate; 0.61 to 0.8, substantial; and\\n\\n0.81 to 0.99, almost perfect. Disagreements were resolved by\\ndiscussions.\\n\\nThe four prospective cohort studies as reported in\\nO\u2019Brien1 did not meet the pre-specified definition for\\nfrequent exposure. However, the questionnaires for two\\nof the included cohorts had asked women about more\\nfrequent talcum powder use. As is standard in systematic\\nreviews to include relevant but unpublished results, we\\ncontacted O\u2019Brien and requested primary data from the\\nNurses\u2019 Health Study 1 (NHS1) and the Sisters Study\\n(SIS) for the highest frequency talc exposure group. The\\ndata from NHS 1 were provided and described in the\\nSupplemental Table 1 and are included in the systematic\\nreview. The data from the SIS study were not provided to\\nus due to the small sample size of exposed individuals in\\nthe highest exposure category (n=2 women).\\n\\nData Extraction\\n\\nData extraction was performed by two authors (SW and RSB).\\nExtracted information included age range, enrollment period,\\ndefinition of frequency of talc use, size of control group or\\ncohort size, number of ovarian cancers, and adjusted hazard\\nratio and odds ratio with 95% CI. Data were included from the\\nhighest reported talc use category to obtain as close to daily\\nuse as possible and the referent group were women who\\nreported no talc exposure. When duplicate reports of the same\\nsubjects were published, the publication reporting the highest\\ntalc use was selected. The senior author was contacted to\\nobtain data for studies that reported frequent perineal talcum\\npowder exposure but did not publish the results on this expo-\\nsure. Disagreements in data extraction were resolved by\\nconsensus.\\n\\nAssessment of Risk of Bias and Study Quality\\n\\nEleven articles met selection criteria. The articles were inde-\\npendently reviewed by two authors (SW and RSB) for quality\\nusing the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) where a score of 0\u20133\\nreflects a very high risk of bias, 4\u20136 refle", "cts a high risk of bias,\\nand 7\u20139 reflects a high-quality study with low risk of bias. The\\nscale assesses the criteria used to select study groups, the\\ncomparability of study groups, and ascertainment exposure\\nor outcome of interest. Results of the validity assessment were\\ndiscussed until agreement was reached (Table 1).\\n\\nData Synthesis\\n\\nIndividual study results were combined using summary esti-\\nmates generated from the random effects model8 and dis-\\nplayed with forest plots. Adjusted odds ratios and the adjusted\\nhazard ratio were combined given the infrequency of ovarian\\ncancer.9 As a sensitivity analysis, we removed the one cohort\\nstudy from the analysis and a study that combined non-\\nperineal talcum powder users with perineal talcum powder\\nusers.\\n\\n\f2528\\n\\nWoolen et al.: Use of Frequent Perineal Talcum Powder and Ovarian Cancer\\n\\nJGIM\\n\\nFigure 1.

The NOS score was calculated for each\\nstudy and median, maximum, and minimum scores were\\ncalculated across all included studies. As sensitivity analyses,\\nwe repeated the meta-analysis first excluding the study with\\nthe NOS score of 4, and then repeated the analysis limited to\\nstudies with an NOS score of 8 or 9.

The number (No.) of women included as cases and controls (or cohort) who were exposed and not exposed are\\nprovided (excluding from the table women who had exposure to talcum powder at less than the highest exposure). The study-specific odds\\nratios and 95% confidence interval are on the right side of the plot.\\n\\nuse of perineal talcum powder products and ovarian cancer was\\n1.47 (P<0.0001, 95% CI 1.31, 1.65) (Fig 2) and there was no\\nsignificant publication bias (Egger's test, P=0.94) (Fig 3). When\\nlimited to the case-control studies, the summary pooled odds\\nratio was 1.49 (P<0.0001, 95% CI 1.29, 1.72) (Supplementary\\nFigures 1 and 2), whereas the odds ratio for the cohort study was\\n1.40 (95% CI 1.17, 1.68). When excluding Wu et al.19 which\\ncombined perineal administration of talcum powder with other\\nmethods, the summary pooled odds ratio was 1.44 (95% CI\\n1.29, 1.60) (Supplementary Figure 3) and the studies remained\\nhomogenous (I2= 6.5%, P=0.382) without publication bias\\n(Egger\u2019s test, P=0.77) (Supplementary Figure 4).\\n\\nGiven the quality of a meta-analysis is dependent on the\\nquality of the studies it includes, we conducted a sensitivity\\nanalysis excluding the study with a NOS grade of 4 (Booth10).\\nThere was no meaningful change after excluding Booth, sum-\\nmary pooled odds ratio 1.48 (P<0.0001, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.69)\\n(Supplementary Figure 5) and the studies remained homogenous\\n(I2= 24.4%, P=0.22) without publication bias (Egger\u2019s test,\\nP=0.88) (Supplementary Figure 6).

The studies remained\\n\\nhomogenous (I2=39.3%, P=0.12) and did not have publication\\nbias (Egger\u2019s test, P=0.97) (Supplementary Figure 8).\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nWe found frequent use of perineal talcum powder is associated\\nwith an increased risk of ovarian cancer, with a pooled adjusted\\nodds ratio of 1.47 (95% CI 1.31, 1.65). The 11 contributing\\nstudies included in the review, including the longest published\\nfollow-up available from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study cohort, were\\nhomogenous, and the summary estimate was robust in the sensi-\\ntivity analysis. This meta-analysis makes a significant contribu-\\ntion to the available evidence as it is the first study that summa-\\nrizes the published cohort and case-control literature that focuses\\non frequent (multiple times per week) rather than ever use of talc.\\nThe precise mechanism whereby talcum powder causes\\novarian cancer is not fully understood. It is widely speculated\\nthat trans-genital migration of talc powder through the fallo-\\npian tubes to the ovaries and peritoneum results in inflamma-\\ntion and a cascade of changes that result in carcinogenesis.20,21\\nTalc fibers are found wit", "hin normal ovaries and within ovarian\\ncancer with \u201ccosmetic\u201d talc use22,23 supporting this theory. A\\ncase series by Steffen et al. reported 10 cases of patients with\\n\u201ccosmetic\u201d talc exposure and serous ovarian cancer evaluated\\nthe surgical specimens as well as cosmetic talcum powder\\n\\n\fJGIM\\n\\nWoolen et al.: Use of Frequent Perineal Talcum Powder and Ovarian Cancer\\n\\n2531\\n\\nFigure 3.

The transmission electron micro-\\nscope tissue analysis and phase contrast microscopy found talc\\nin every serous ovarian cancer and anthophyllite asbestos in\\n80% (8/10) of the serous ovarian cancers, which matched the\\ntalcum-based powder from the 1950s. Asbestiform talc is\\nconsidered, along with asbestos, as a class 1 carcinogen for\\novarian cancer, by the International Agency for Research on\\nCancer.24 Thus, the strongest and most widely believed theory\\nis that asbestiform talc fibers and asbestos fibers are the\\netiological agents leading to the elevated cancer risk associated\\nwith their use.\\n\\nThe pooled odds ratio of 1.47 is higher than that of six\\nadditional systematic reviews which included case-control\\nstudies, all of which also report a statistically significant\\nassociation between talc and ovarian cancer (range of adjusted\\nodds ratios: 1.24\u20131.35).2\u20137 O\u2019Brien et al.1 concluded that\\nperineal talcum powder exposure in cohort studies was not\\nsignificantly associated with ovarian cancer. However, when\\nO\u2019Brien limited to women with patent fallopian tubes the\\nhazard was 1.13 (95% CI: 1.01 to 1.26) for ever versus never\\nuse and there was a dose response with increasing risk with\\nincreasing frequency of talcum powder use with a hazard ratio\\nof 1.40 (95% CI: 1.17 to 1.68) for daily users. The magnitude\\nof the higher association in our study compared to prior case-\\ncontrol and cohort meta-analyses was likely due to our focus\\non frequent rather than any talcum powder users, inclusion of\\nquality studies, and consistent definition of the exposure.\\n\\nOur meta-analysis included both case-control and cohort\\nobservational studies allowing use to include more cancer cases\\nthan cohort alone. Although there is the general belief that\\ncohort studies are better than case-control studies, both can\\nprovide accurate and meaningful information about statistical\\n\\nassociations. Since most publications on talc used a case-control\\ndesign with detailed quantification of the type and frequency of\\ntalc exposure missing from most of the cohort studies, it is\\nimportant to include the data from the case-control studies in\\nany summary estimate of the association with ovarian cancer.\\nWhile cohort studies can provide a superior design for some\\nresearch questions, the method provides less useful results when\\nquantification of the exposure is too crude to provide a mean-\\ningful estimation of exposure. Cohort studies for talcum powder\\ndid not define the type of powder exposure, consistently define\\nfrequency and duration, capture changes in exposure over time,\\nand relied on recall by participants for exposure which may\\ninvolve misclassification as would be expected in case control\\nstudies.25\u201327 Although it is well known that case-control study\\ndesign is susceptible to recall bias and misclassification, the bias\\nwas likely limited to participant recollection of their exposure\\nrather than influenced by the media, given there was no public-\\nity on the topic at the time of most publications: the first legal\\ncase was reported in the press in 2014 long after most studies\\ncompleted recruitment. The one study where patient recruitment\\noccurred after 2014 patients was Schildkraut et al.,17 where\\nrecruitment occurred between 2010 and 1015, and they adjusted\\nfor the additional bias.\\n\\nStrengths and Limitations\\n\\nThe primary strength of our study is our focus on frequent\\nusers of perineal talcum powder. Among women who report\\ntalcum powder use, the most common frequency is daily\\nuse,13 and this is the first systematic review to focus on\\nmultiple times per week users. The results were highly con-\\nsistent and homogenous, and the included studies were of high\\nquality. The work has limitations as well. We constructed our\\n\\n\f2532\\n\\nWoolen et al.: Use of Frequent Perineal Talcum Powder and Ovarian Cancer\\n\\nJGIM\\n\\nselection criteria prospectively to include studies with multiple\\ntimes per week and as close to daily talcum powder exposure\\nas possible. However, this meant that cohort and case-control\\nstudies that might have frequent-use patients were excluded if\\nthe questionnaire did not explicitly capture this information.\\nThe definition of talcum powder use varied by frequency and\\nduration between the case-control and cohort studies. Addi-\\ntionally, studies by Cook et al.12, Mills et al.15, Rosenblatt\\net al.16, and Schildkraut et al.17 were unable to differentiate\\nbetween use of perineal powders and the small subset using\\ncorns", "tarch (estimated at 1.5%). However, the differences in\\ndefinition and small inclusion of cornstarch likely did not\\naffect the results as there was no evidence for statistical het-\\nerogeneity in our study. The included studies were adjusted for\\nmultiple covariates. The possibility of additional confounders\\nto the studies likely exists.\\n\\nConclusions and Implications\\n\\nIn this analysis of pooled data from 10 case-control studies and\\na single cohort study, the frequent use of perineal talcum\\npowder use is associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer.\\nThese results support women avoiding the frequent use of\\ntalcum powder in the perineal area.\\n\\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supple-\\nmentary material available at https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-022-\\n07414-7.\\n\\nAcknowledgements: We thank Evans Whitaker, MD MLIS, for his\\nhelp in providing the literature review.\\nWe thank Katie O\u2019Brien, PhD, for her help in providing data from the\\nSIS and NHS1 studies.\\n\\nCorresponding Author: Sean A Woolen, MD MSc; Department of\\nRadiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California San\\nFrancisco, San Francisco, CA, USA (e-mail: sean.woolen@ucsf.edu).\\n\\nDeclarations:\\n\\nConflict of Interest: Sean Woolen: No relevant disclosures.\\nAnn A Lazar: No relevant disclosures.\\nRebecca Smith-Bindman: Served as a paid expert witness for the\\nplaintiffs in the talcum powder litigation.\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n\\n1.

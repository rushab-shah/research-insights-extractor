Menstrual characteristics, reproductive and contraceptive history\\nand history of exposure to various environmental factors were compared between 235 women with his-\\ntologically diagnosed epithelial ovarian cancer and 451 controls. High gravidity, hysterectomy, female sterilisa-\\ntion and oral contraceptive use were associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer. Infertility and late age\\nat menopause were associated with an increase in risk. While these factors were related, they were each found\\nto be independently associated with ovarian cancer risk after adjusting for the effect of the other factors.\\n\\nWhile results from recent case -control studies have con-\\nsistently shown that multiparity and oral contraceptive use\\nare associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer, the\\nassociation of the cancer with other reproductive, hormonal\\nand related factors such as age at menopause, history of\\nhysterectomy or use of oestrogen replacement therapy is less\\nclear. We have conducted a hospital-based case-control\\nstudy in London and Oxford which was designed to inves-\\ntigate the independent contributions of reproductive history\\nand contraceptive use to ovarian cancer risk. In particular, it\\nwas planned to attempt to segregate out the effect on risk of\\ninfertility from that of voluntary limitation of family size.\\nThe association between ovarian cancer and other possible\\naetiological agents was also examined.\\n\\nSubjects and methods\\n\\noral\\n\\nBetween October 1978 and February 1983 five interviewers\\nidentified and questioned women with a diagnosis of ovarian\\ncancer and women selected as controls at 13 hospitals in\\nLondon and two in Oxford. A standard questionnaire was\\nused to obtain information on reproductive and menstrual\\nhistory and on exposure to various substances such as\\nexogenous oestrogens, cigarettes and talc. A month by month\\nrecord was made of the specific contraceptive methods used\\nby each woman between the ages of 16 and 45 years, or, if\\nunder 45 years, up to the time of diagnosis (cases) or inter-\\nview (controls). The methods were classified as sheaths,\\ndiaphragms,\\ndevices,\\nor\\n'other methods' (spermicides, rhythm and coitus interruptus).\\nWomen who reported using a contraceptive diaphragm were\\nasked if they had stored it in talc. Also recorded were\\nmonths during which a woman was not using contraception\\ndue to sexual abstinence, pregnancy, menopause or because\\nshe or her partner had been sterilised. The other months\\nwhen a woman reported using no method of contraception\\nalthough sexually active have been classified as months of\\n'unprotected intercourse'. The total duration of use of each\\ncontraceptive method, of any contraceptive method, of unp-\\nrotected intercourse and of pregnancy were computed for\\neach woman.\\n\\ncontraceptives\\n\\nintrauterine\\n\\nThe study was confinied to women aged less than 65 years\\nwhose diagnosis of ovarian cancer had been made within two\\nyears of interview. A total of 280 cases were interviewed and\\npathological specimens were histologically classified by Pro-\\nfessor C. Hudson and Dr M. Curling from St Bartholomews\\nHospital. A total of 235 women with epithelial ovarian\\ncancer were included in the analyses. For these women, the\\ntumour type was described as serous in 101 (43%) cases,\\nmucinous in 38 (15%) cases, endometrioid in 52 (22%) cases\\n\\nCorrespondence: M. Booth.\\nReceived 3 February 1989; and in revised form 9 May 1989.\\n\\nand clear cell in 12 (5%) cases. Mixed and undifferentiated\\ntypes of epithelial tumours accounted for the remaining 32\\n(14%) cases. Excluded from the analyses were nine women\\nwith a non-epithelial ovarian neoplasm, 11 with a primary\\ntumour in an unknown site outside the ovary, 21 with a\\nprimary tumour in an unknown site although one consistent\\nwith an ovarian origin, one with a benign tumour and three\\nfor whom pathology material could not be obtained.\\n\\nFor each case it was planned to select two age-matched\\ncontrols from women being treated in the same hospital.\\nWomen with bilateral oophorectomy were excluded from the\\ncontrol group as were women admitted with conditions that\\nhave been related to reproductive history or oral contracep-\\ntive use (all circulatory and gynaecological diseases, gallblad-\\", "nder and thyroid diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, malignant\\ndisease of the breast, uterus and bladder, and melanoma).\\nIt proved logistically impossible to select two age-matched\\ncontrols for each case from the same hospital and it was\\ndecided merely to ensure that the age distribution of the\\ncontrols was approximately the same as that of the cases.\\nFor 63 cases recruited from a London hospital where only\\ncancer patients are treated, controls were selected from other\\nLondon hospitals. For these reasons, the data were analysed\\nusing an unmatched approach with adjustments being made\\nto relative risk estimates for age and socio-economic status.\\nA total of 451 controls have been included in the analyses.\\nThe admission diagnoses for these patients were gastrointes-\\ntinal disease (105), bone or joint disease (70), respiratory\\ndisease (39), renal or other urinary disease (35), neurological\\ndisease (30), fractures or other injuries (28), skin or sub-\\ncutaneous tissue disease (17), malignant neoplasms of the\\ndigestive organs (15) and bone or skin (2), benign neoplasms\\nof the digestive organs (4) respiratory system (4) and other\\nsites (8) and various other conditions and symptoms (94).\\nThis final category included patients with haemorrhoids (15)\\nand those with symptoms relating to the respiratory system\\n(10), gastrointestinal tract (20) and urinary system (10).\\n\\nMaximum likelihood\\n\\nestimates of relative\\n\\nrisk (RR)\\ntogether with their 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and\\ntests for trend where appropriate were computed by multiple\\nlogistic regression techniques (Breslow & Day, 1980) using\\nthe GLIM statistical package (Baker & Nelder, 1978). All\\nrelative risks have been adjusted for age in 5-year strata\\n(20-24, 25-29, .\\n. 60-64) and for social class in six\\ncategories (1,II,JII non-manual, III manual, IV and V). Age\\nof the cases was taken as age at diagnosis of ovarian cancer\\nand of the controls as age at interview. Social class was based\\non occupation (Office of Population Censuses and Surveys,\\n1970) using husband's occupation for ever married women\\nand own occupation for those who had never married. Other\\nrelative risk adjustments and tests for trend have been made\\nwith the exposures as continuous variables. When the data\\nwere examined by place of interview (London or Oxford),\\nin the risk estimates\\nthere were no notable differences\\n\\n.\\n\\n\fassociated with the major variables of interest. The relative\\nrisks have not, therefore, been stratified by place of interview.\\nThe terms nulligravid and gravid have been used to denote,\\nrespectively, women who have never knowingly conceived\\nand women who have had at least one pregnancy. Parity has\\nbeen defined as number of live and still births.\\n\\nResults\\n\\n(X2\\n\\nrisk\\n\\nthan\\n\\ncancer\\n\\nhigher\\n\\nof ovarian\\n\\nThe age distributions of the cases and controls are shown in\\nTable I. The average age of the cases was slightly higher than\\nthat of the controls. There was an excess of cases in social\\nII, and III non-manual (58%) as compared to\\nclasses I,\\ncontrols (43%) (P = 0.05) and, because of this, all relative\\nrisks have been adjusted for social class as well as age. Table\\nII shows the relative risks for ovarian cancer associated with\\nvarious aspects of pregnancy history. Nulligravid women had\\ngravid women\\na\\n(RR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.6). The relative risks were elevated\\nboth in nulligravid women who had been sexually active and\\nin those who had not, although significantly so only for the\\nsexually active. Among those who had ever been pregnant,\\nthe relative risks decreased as the number of pregnancies\\nincreased,\\n(trend) = 4.3, P <0.05). Similarly, among\\nparous women, the higher the parity the lower the relative\\nrisks (X2 (trend) = 3.9, P <0.05). After adjusting for parity,\\nthe\\nassociated with successive numbers of\\nincomplete pregnancies (spontaneous and induced abortions)\\nalso decreased although the\\nstatistically\\nsignificant (X2 (trend) = 0.5). Women having their first preg-\\nnancy after the age of 35 years had a significantly higher risk\\nof ovarian cancer than women with a first pregnancy before\\nthe age of 20 years. Their risk was also higher than that for\\nnulligravid women. There was, however, no marked nor\\nsignificant trend of increasing risk the later the age at first\\npregnancy (X2 (trend) = 1.0). Analyses by age at first livebirth\\ngave similar findings. After adjustment for number of livebir-\\nths, women who had breastfed for more than two years in\\ntotal had over three times the risk of ovarian cancer com-\\npared to women who had never breastfed (P < 0.05) but\\noverall, there was no significant trend the longer the duration\\nof lactation.\\n\\ntrend was not\\n\\nrelative\\n\\nrisks\\n\\nAnalyses of infertility and subfertility as risk factors for\\novarian cancer were restricted to the 213 (91 %) cases and 240\\n(93%) controls who reported that they had ever been sexually\\nactive. Among these women, 30 (14%) w", "ith ovarian cancer and\\n34 (8%) controls reported, when so questioned, that they had\\nhad problems in becoming pregnant and, of these, 16 cases and\\n12 controls had never conceived. Analysis of the data on\\ncontraceptive use suggested that there were other women who\\nmight have been infertile or subfertile. Although sexually active,\\nthey had used contraception infrequently or not at all and had\\nhad few or no pregnancies. For all women who had ever been\\nsexually active, the risk of ovarian cancer increased with\\nincreasing duration of unprotected intercourse after adjustment\\nfor gravidity (X2 (trend) = 10.2, P <0.01). The effect was most\\nmarked among nulligravid women who reported more than 10\\nyears of unprotected intercourse. Their risk was over six times\\nthat of nulligravid women who reported less than three months\\nof unprotected intercourse (Table III). Among gravid women,\\nthose reporting over 10 years of unprotected intercourse had a\\nhigher risk than other gravid women. There was no significant\\ntrend in risk associated with the duration of use of any\\n\\nTable I Age distribution and average age of cases and controls\\n\\nAge (years)\\n20-34\\n35-44\\n45-54\\n55-64\\nTotal\\nAverage age (years)\\n\\nCases (%)\\n13 (5.5)\\n27 (11.5)\\n87 (37.0)\\n108 (46.0)\\n235\\n52.4\\n\\nControls (%)\\n33 (7.3)\\n75 (16.6)\\n156 (34.6)\\n187 (41.5)\\n451\\n51.4\\n\\nRISK FACTORS FOR OVARIAN CANCER\\n\\n593\\n\\nTable II\\n\\nRelative risks for ovarian cancer associated with pregnancy\\n\\nhistory\\n\\nVariable\\nGravidityb\\nGravid\\nNulligravid\\n\\nNulligravid and ever\\nsexually active\\nNulligravid and never\\nsexually active\\nNumber of pregnancies\\n\\n0\\n\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n\\nCases\\n\\nControls\\n\\nRR\\n\\n(95% CI)\\n\\n176\\n59\\n\\n376\\n74\\n\\n1.Oa\\n1.7\\n\\n(1.1 -2.6)\\n\\n37\\n\\n22\\n\\n59\\n\\n43\\n\\n63\\n\\n37\\n\\n13\\n\\n20\\n\\n44\\n\\n1.9\\n\\n(1.1-3.1)\\n\\n30\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n(0.8-2.6)\\n\\n74\\n\\n71\\n\\n107\\n\\n98\\n\\n41\\n\\n59\\n\\n1.Oa\\n\\n0.8\\n\\n0.7\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n(0.4-1.3)\\n\\n(0.4-1.1)\\n\\n(0.3-0.8)\\n\\n(0.2-0.8)\\n\\n(0.2-0.8)\\n\\nx2 for trend = 4.3 P<0.05\\n(gravid women only)\\n\\nEstimated reduction in relative\\nassociated with each pregnancq\\n\\nrisk\\n\\ny\\n\\n0.86\\n\\n(0.78-0.94)\\n\\nParityb\\n0\\n\\n2\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n66\\n48\\n61\\n40\\n12\\n\\n8\\n\\n87\\n\\n84\\n\\n127\\n\\n88\\n30\\n\\n34\\n\\nI.Oa\\n0.7\\n\\n0.6\\n\\n0.6\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n0.3\\n\\n(0.4-\\n(0.4-\\n(0.3-\\n(0.2-\\n(0.1-\\n\\n1.2)\\n1.0)\\n-1.0)\\n1.0)\\n-0.7)\\n\\nx2 for trend = 3.9 P<0.05\\n(parous women only)\\n\\nEstimated reduction in relative risk\\nassociated with each birth\\nNo. of incomplete preg-\\nnanciesb.c\\n\\n0.84\\n\\n(0.75-0.94)\\n\\n0\\n\\n2\\n\\n330\\n\\n83\\n\\n18\\n\\n19\\n\\n185\\n\\n39\\n\\n7\\n\\n4\\n\\nX2\\n\\nl .02\\n0.9\\n0.7\\n0.6\\n= 0.5\\n\\n(0.6-\\n(0.3-\\n(0.2-\\n\\n-1.4)\\n-1.8)\\n-1.7)\\n\\n0.92\\n\\n(0.75- 1.13)\\n\\nEstimated reduction in relative\\nrisk associated with each incomplete pregnancy\\nAge at first pregnancy\\n(years)d\\n\\n15- 19\\n20 -24\\n25 -29\\n30-34\\n35\\n\\nNulligravid\\n\\nMonths of lactatione\\nNone\\n\\n<6\\n7-12\\n13- 18\\n19-24\\n,25\\n\\n26\\n73\\n49\\n17\\n9\\n59\\nx2 for trend =\\n\\n65\\n\\n1.02\\n\\n182\\n0.9\\n96\\n1.2\\n1.2\\n29\\n4.1\\n4\\n2.0\\n74\\n1.0 (gravid women only)\\n\\n(0.5- 1.5)\\n(0.7-2.2)\\n(0.8-2.7)\\n(1.1 -15.1)\\n(1.1 -3.7)\\n\\n44\\n66\\n29\\n13\\n5\\n12\\n\\n107\\n124\\n80\\n29\\n7\\n15\\n\\n1.0o\\n1.3\\n0.9\\n1.2\\n2.1\\n3.4\\nx2 for trend = 1.8\\n\\n(0.8-\\n(0.5-\\n(0.5-\\n(0.7-\\n(1.1\\n\\n-2.2)\\n-1.6)\\n-2.5)\\n-6.7)\\n-10.8)\\n\\nb\\n\\nAll relative risks adjusted for age and social class.

As sterilisation is often a consequence ofhigh\\nparity, the risks associated with gravidity were not adjusted for\\nsterilisation as this was considered to be overadjustment. In this\\nstudy, 40% of the sterilised women had five or more children\\ncompared with 9% of the unsterilised women. Each of the\\nvariables remained statistically significantly related to ovarian\\ncancer risk, suggesting that each may be independently\\nassociated with the risk of developing ovarian cancer.\\n\\nThere was no significant difference between the percentage of\\ncases (53%) and controls (57%) who had ever smoked cigaret-\\ntes. No cases or controls reported having worked with asbestos.\\nNo cases but three controls reported a radiation-induced\\nmenopause.\\n\\nWomen who reported using talc more than once a week or\\ndaily had higher risks of ovarian cancer than women who\\nreported less frequent use (Table XII).

We also found that the greater the\\nnumber of incomplete pregnancies the lower the\\nrisk,\\nalthough the trend was not significant. Most other studies\\nhave not investigated if women of low gravidity have an\\nincreased risk of ovarian cancer because of reduced fertility\\nor because of voluntary limitation of family size, although\\nJoly et al. (1974), McGowan et al. (1979) and Nasca et al.\\n(1984) found a higher risk in women who had tried to\\nconceive but had failed. Our findings also suggest that infer-\\ntility is a risk factor for ovarian cancer. Women who had not\\nconceived but had been sexually active for more than 10\\nyears without using contraception had about six times the\\nrisk of all other women. Approximately half these women\\nhad undergone investigations for infertility. For only five\\ncases and one control was the cause of their infertility deter-\\nmined. Thus, it is not possible to assess whether this high risk\\ngroup had normal or impaired ovarian function. Subfertility\\nmay also be associated with ovarian cancer. Gravid women\\nreporting over 10 years of unprotected intercourse had a\\n50% higher risk than other gravid women, but this increase\\nwas not statistically significant.\\n\\nAge at first pregnancy was not found to be associated with\\novarian cancer risk although women having a first pregnancy\\nafter the age of 35 years had a higher risk compared to\\nwomen having a first pregnancy at earlier ages and to nullig-\\nravid women. Since subfertility might be a risk factor for\\novarian cancer, the relative risks associated with age at first\\npregnancy were also adjusted for duration of unprotected\\nintercourse. The raised risk for women ", "with a first pregnancy\\nafter 35 years persisted (RR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.1- 14.2). Results\\nfrom other studies regarding the risk for women having a\\nfirst child at relatively older ages are inconclusive, some\\nfinding no association (Newhouse et al., 1977; Casagrande et\\nal., 1979; Cramer et al., 1983; Lesher et al., 1985), others an\\nincreased risk (Joly et al.,\\n1979;\\nHildreth et al., 1981; Franceschi et al., 1982). Only Frances-\\nchi et al. (1982) found the increased risk to be statistically\\nsignificant and independent of parity.\\n\\n1974; McGowan et al.,\\n\\nOverall, there was no association between use of any con-\\ntraception and ovarian cancer. Of the specific methods\\nstudied, female sterilisation and use of oral contraception\\nwere associated with a significant reduction in risk and no\\nmethod was associated with a significant increase in risk. The\\nassociations remained after adjusting for gravidity and dur-\\nation of unprotected intercourse,\\nthe measure used to\\nindicate infertility. While few studies have examined the\\nassociation between female sterilisation and ovarian cancer,\\nthe relation between oral contraceptives and ovarian cancer\\nhas been demonstrated in many studies (Booth & Beral,\\n1985). Like others, we demonstrated that the longer oral\\ncontraceptives had been used, the lower the risk. Our findings\\nalso suggested that the earlier the age at first use the lower\\nthe risk and that the protective effect of oral contraceptives\\npersists after their use is stopped.\\n\\nIt has been suggested that inhibition of ovulation, as\\ninduced by pregnancy and oral contraceptives, is the factor\\nwhich protects against ovarian cancer (Fathalla, 1971). If so,\\npostpartum anovulation associated with lactation might also\\nbe expected to be protective. We found no evidence that the\\nlonger a woman had breastfed the lower her risk of ovarian\\ncancer. Indeed, the highest risk was found in those who had\\nbreastfed longest. Results from other studies are contradic-\\n\\n\ftory (Cramer et al., 1983; Mori et al., 1984; Risch et al.,\\n1983; Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study, 1987).\\n\\nOur finding that age at menarche was not associated with\\nrisk is consistent with results from most other studies (Casa-\\ngrande et al., 1979; McGowan et al., 1979; Hildreth et al.,\\n1981; Franceschi et al., 1982). Age at natural menopause,\\nhowever, was strongly related to risk. While Hildreth et al.\\n(1981), Franceschi et al. (1982) and Tzonou et al. (1984) also\\ndemonstrated that the later the age at menopause the greater\\nthe risk, other studies have found no association (West, 1966;\\nNewhouse et al., 1977; Annegers et al., 1979; McGowan et\\nal., 1979; Cramer et al., 1983).\\n\\nA lower frequency of hysterectomy, of unilateral oophorec-\\ntomy, or of both among cases compared to controls has also\\nbeen reported from several other studies (Wynder et al.,\\n1969; Joly et al., 1974; Annegers et al., 1979; McGowan et\\nal., 1979; Franceschi et al., 1982; Cramer et al., 1983). As\\nthese studies were case-control in design, there may have\\nbeen some misclassification of controls who, rather than\\nhaving a hysterectomy with ovarian conservation, actually\\nhad a hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy. Another\\nexplanation for the findings might be that if at hysterectomy\\na woman's ovaries look diseased, it is likely that they are\\nremoved. If the diseased ovaries were precancerous, those\\nwomen who might otherwise have developed ovarian cancer\\ndo not. Following hysterectomy with ovarian conservation,\\nreduced ovarian function or ovarian failure occurs in a pro-\\nportion of women, due possibly to the blood supply to the\\novaries being compromised (Beavis et al., 1969; Ellsworth et\\nal., 1983). Female sterilisation was also associated with a low\\nrisk of ovarian cancer. Neil et al. (1975) have suggested that\\nthe menstrual disturbance that many women experience after\\nsterilisation may reflect changed ovarian function due to\\ndamage to the vascular supply to the ovaries.\\nIf both\\nhysterectomy and female sterilisation can indirectly affect\\novarian function then both procedures could also influence\\nthe risk of ovarian cancer.\\n\\nRecent investigators have shown that the longer a woman\\novulates the greater her risk of ovarian cancer (Casagrande et\\nal., 1979; Hildreth et al., 1981; Franceschi et al., 1982; Wu et al.,\\n1988). We also found that risk increased the longer the duration\\nof ovulation. Duration of ovulation is, however, highly cor-\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nRISK FACTORS FOR OVARIAN CANCER\\n\\n597\\n\\nrelated with the 'anovulatory' factors used to estimate the\\nexposure. In an attempt to determine whether duration of\\novulation had an effect over and above that expressed by its\\nrelation with these factors, the risks and trends were adjusted for\\nduration of anovulation due to pregnancy and oral contracep-\\ntive use and, where appropriate, for age at menopause. The\\nsignificance of the effect disappeared. We conclude that it is not\\npossible to", " determine from these data whether it is the above\\nfactors which inhibit ovulation that prevent ovarian cancer,\\nwhether repeated ovulations promote it, or whether a combina-\\ntion of both is acting.\\n\\nOur finding of no overall relationship between hormone\\nreplacement therapy and ovarian cancer supports those of other\\ninvestigators (Newhouse et al., 1977; Hildreth et al., 1981; Weiss\\net al., 1982). An increased risk associated with the therapy was\\nfound among women who reported hysterectomy, but the\\nfinding was based on very few cases and may have been due to\\nchance. We did not find an increased risk associated with\\noestrogen therapy for any particular tumour types as suggested\\nby Cramer et al. (1981) and Weiss et al. (1982).\\n\\nThe evidence linking talc with ovarian cancer is controversial\\n(Anonymous, 1977; Roe, 1979; Longo & Young 1979; Cramer\\net al., 1982; Hartge et al., 1983). In this study, women who\\nreported talc use in the genital area more than once a week or\\ndaily had higher risks of ovarian cancer than women who used\\ntalc less frequently. The women were not asked how long they\\nhad been using talc. It is possible that because of their symptoms\\nor disease-related pelvic examinations, the frequency of current\\ntalc use by the cases may not have reflected their frequency of\\npast use. Since these and other results (Cramer et al., 1982;\\nHartge et al., 1983) are insufficient to reject an association,\\nfurther work is needed on the relation between genital use of talc\\nand ovarian cancer.\\n\\nWe would like to thank the Imperial Cancer Research Fund for\\nfinancing the study, Professor Sir Richard Doll for helpful advice,\\nProfessor Christopher Hudson and Dr Marigold Curling for reviewing\\nthe histology, Dr Eve Wiltshaw, the consultants, nurses and other staff\\nof the participating hospitals for their co-operation and support of the\\nstudy, Ann Bateman, Kate Rodriques, Gillian Saunders and Rosalie\\nThomson for their skilful interviewing, and Nina Saroi for typing the\\nmanuscript.

Prior systematic reviews focused on ever use.\\nThe purpose of this study is to estimate the association\\nbetween frequent (at least 2 times per week) perineal tal-\\ncum powder use and ovarian cancer.\\nMETHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was\\nconducted according to meta-analysis of observational\\nstudies in epidemiology guidelines. Study protocol was\\nprospectively registered at PROSPERO (registration num-\\nber CRD42020172720). Searches were performed in\\nPubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central\\nRegister of Controlled Trials databases from their incep-\\ntion to August 2, 2021. Case-control and cohort studies\\nwere included if they reported frequent perineal talcum\\npowder use and an adjusted odds ratio or hazard ratio for\\novarian cancer. Review for inclusion, data extraction, and\\nquality assessment (using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale\\n[NOS]) were performed independently by two reviewers.\\nPooled adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals\\nwere generated from the random effects model. Heteroge-\\nneity was quantified with I2 statistic. Funnel plot and\\nEger\u2019s test were performed to assess publication bias.\\nSubgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed for\\ntesting the robustness of the overall findings.\\nRESULTS: Initial database searches returned 761\\nunique citations and after review, eleven studies describ-\\ning 66,876 patients, and 6542 cancers were included\\n(Cohen\u2019s \u03ba = 0.88). Publication quality was high (median\\nNOS = 8, range: 4 to 9). Frequent talcum powder use was\\nassociated with an elevated risk of ovarian cancer (adjust-\\ned pooled summary odds ratio 1.47 (95% CI 1.31, 1.65,\\nP<0.0001). There was no evidence of bias and low hetero-\\ngeneity (I2= 24%, P=0.22). There was no meaningful dif-\\nference limiting analysis to publications with a NOS qual-\\nity score of 8 or 9 or limiting studies based on study\\ndesign.\\nCONCLUSIONS: This review suggests an increased risk of\\novarian cancer associated with frequent perineal powder\\nexposure of 31\u201365%.\\n\\nReceived September 14, 2021\\nAccepted January 13, 2022\\nPublished online February 2, 2022\\n\\n2526\\n\\nKEY WORDS: talcum powder; ovarian neoplasm; women\u2019s health; meta-\\nanalysis.\\n\\nJ Gen Intern Med 37(10):2526\u201332\\nDOI: 10.1007/s11606-022-07414-7\\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nTalc, the primary ingredient in baby powder, is a naturally\\noccurring mineral known for its softness and absorbency and\\nhas been added to a broad range of personal care products\\nsince the early part of the twentieth century. To date, there\\nhave been seven systematic reviews and pooled data studies1\u20137\\nof the relationship between talcum powder products and ovar-\\nian cancer. All studies including retrospective case-control\\nstudies have found a positive association.2\u20137 The most recent\\nreview by O\u2019Brien1 limited analysis to the four prospective\\ncohort studies and in its main conclusion stated there was no\\nstatistically significant association between genital talc use\\nand ovarian cancer.\\n\\nThe differences in conclusions between the metanalyses are\\nat least partially due to the inconsistent talcum-based powder\\nexposure questions regarding the frequency and type of expo-\\nsure. To harmonize the exposure measurements across the\\ngreatest number of studies, prior meta-analyses primarily fo-\\ncused on quantifying the association between ever versus\\nnever use of talcum powder products and ovarian cancer.\\nHowever, ever use is a non-specific exposure that could dilute\\nor obscure a meaningful association as ever use would com-\\nbine women with low and high exposures to talcum powder.\\nKnowledge of ovarian cancer risks are important for wom-\\nen\u2019s health and important to guide regulatory oversight. The\\npurpose of this analysis is to estimate the risk of ovarian cancer\\nassociated with the frequent use of talcum powder products.\\nWe hypothesize that assessment of ovarian cancer risk among\\nfrequent users of talcum powder products would provide a\\nmore meaningful assessment of its carcinogenicity.\\n\\n\fJGIM\\n\\nWoolen et ", "al.: Use of Frequent Perineal Talcum Powder and Ovarian Cancer\\n\\n2527\\n\\nMETHODS\\n\\nWe conducted a systematic review of the literature and meta-\\nanalysis to assess the association between the frequent perineal\\nexposure to talc and ovarian cancer following the Meta-\\nanalyses of Observational studies (MOOSE) reporting guide-\\nlines. A study protocol was developed in advance and regis-\\ntered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic\\nReviews (PROSPERO) on April 28, 2020 (registration num-\\nber: CRD42020172720).\\n\\nSearch Strategy and Information Sources\\n\\nComprehensive searches were performed by an expert health\\nscience informationist from inception of the relevant databases\\nto August 2, 2021. Searches were completed in the following:\\nPubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central\\nRegister of Controlled Trials. Each search consisted of talcum\\npowder and ovarian cancer concept blocks, which can be\\nviewed in the supplemental material. No date, language, or\\nother restrictions were incorporated into the searches. Dupli-\\ncate citations were removed in Endnote X9.3.1 (Clarivate\\nAnalytics). The references of all publications were searched\\nto identify additional publications.\\n\\nEligibility Criteria and Study Selection\\n\\nSelection of studies included observational cohort and case-\\ncontrol study designs. Studies were included if they reported\\nprimary data on frequent, defined as multiple (2 or more) times\\nper week perineal exposure to talc, and reported an adjusted\\nodds ratio or hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) for\\novarian malignancy. Other uses of talcum powder, including\\napplications to the body, were excluded to isolate exposure\\nmechanism to perineal application. Conference abstracts,\\nretracted manuscripts, narrative reviews, editorials, case\\nreports, and manuscripts not reporting the location or frequen-\\ncy of talcum powder application were excluded.\\n\\nStudies were screened for inclusion using prespecified se-\\nlection criteria by a single author (SW). Selection criteria\\nincluded publication of primary data, reporting on multiple\\ntimes per week (\u2265 2 times per week) perineal exposure to\\ntalcum powder including direct application of talcum powder\\nto the perineum and rectum, application to underwear or\\nsanitary napkins, or on birth control devices like diaphragms\\nand risk for ovarian malignancy. Studies were also selected for\\nbaseline quality requiring a multivariable risk adjustment,\\nstudy size (n>10 cancers), and defined research methods to\\nallow assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria (flow\\ndiagram Fig. 1). The search resulted in 761 citations, which\\nwere screened at the title and abstract level by a single author\\n(SW). The full manuscripts of relevant citations (n=52) were\\nindependently reviewed by two authors (SW and RSB).\\nAgreement for inclusion was calculated using the Cohen k\\nwith the following scale: 0.01 to 0.20 indicates slight; 0.21 to\\n0.40, fair; 0.41 to 0.60, moderate; 0.61 to 0.8, substantial; and\\n\\n0.81 to 0.99, almost perfect. Disagreements were resolved by\\ndiscussions.\\n\\nThe four prospective cohort studies as reported in\\nO\u2019Brien1 did not meet the pre-specified definition for\\nfrequent exposure. However, the questionnaires for two\\nof the included cohorts had asked women about more\\nfrequent talcum powder use. As is standard in systematic\\nreviews to include relevant but unpublished results, we\\ncontacted O\u2019Brien and requested primary data from the\\nNurses\u2019 Health Study 1 (NHS1) and the Sisters Study\\n(SIS) for the highest frequency talc exposure group. The\\ndata from NHS 1 were provided and described in the\\nSupplemental Table 1 and are included in the systematic\\nreview. The data from the SIS study were not provided to\\nus due to the small sample size of exposed individuals in\\nthe highest exposure category (n=2 women).\\n\\nData Extraction\\n\\nData extraction was performed by two authors (SW and RSB).\\nExtracted information included age range, enrollment period,\\ndefinition of frequency of talc use, size of control group or\\ncohort size, number of ovarian cancers, and adjusted hazard\\nratio and odds ratio with 95% CI. Data were included from the\\nhighest reported talc use category to obtain as close to daily\\nuse as possible and the referent group were women who\\nreported no talc exposure. When duplicate reports of the same\\nsubjects were published, the publication reporting the highest\\ntalc use was selected. The senior author was contacted to\\nobtain data for studies that reported frequent perineal talcum\\npowder exposure but did not publish the results on this expo-\\nsure. Disagreements in data extraction were resolved by\\nconsensus.\\n\\nAssessment of Risk of Bias and Study Quality\\n\\nEleven articles met selection criteria. The articles were inde-\\npendently reviewed by two authors (SW and RSB) for quality\\nusing the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) where a score of 0\u20133\\nreflects a very high risk of bias, 4\u20136 refle", "cts a high risk of bias,\\nand 7\u20139 reflects a high-quality study with low risk of bias. The\\nscale assesses the criteria used to select study groups, the\\ncomparability of study groups, and ascertainment exposure\\nor outcome of interest. Results of the validity assessment were\\ndiscussed until agreement was reached (Table 1).\\n\\nData Synthesis\\n\\nIndividual study results were combined using summary esti-\\nmates generated from the random effects model8 and dis-\\nplayed with forest plots. Adjusted odds ratios and the adjusted\\nhazard ratio were combined given the infrequency of ovarian\\ncancer.9 As a sensitivity analysis, we removed the one cohort\\nstudy from the analysis and a study that combined non-\\nperineal talcum powder users with perineal talcum powder\\nusers.\\n\\n\f2528\\n\\nWoolen et al.: Use of Frequent Perineal Talcum Powder and Ovarian Cancer\\n\\nJGIM\\n\\nFigure 1. Flow diagram of study selection.\\n\\nHeterogeneity was evaluated by inspecting funnel plots,\\nand by calculating the I2 values. Publication bias was evalu-\\nated by visual inspection of the funnel plot and statistically\\nwith Egger\u2019s test. The NOS score was calculated for each\\nstudy and median, maximum, and minimum scores were\\ncalculated across all included studies. As sensitivity analyses,\\nwe repeated the meta-analysis first excluding the study with\\nthe NOS score of 4, and then repeated the analysis limited to\\nstudies with an NOS score of 8 or 9. SAS v. 9.4 was used, and\\ntwo-sidedP-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically\\nsignificant.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nInitial database searches returned 761 unique citations\\n(Fig. 1). After title and abstract review, 52 potential\\ncitations remained. After full-text review, 11 publica-\\ntions met\\nthe inclusion criteria including a total of\\n6542 ovarian cancer cases and 66,876 women\\n(Table 2).1,10\u201319 The interrater agreement in determining\\nthe final study cohort from the 52 full-text reviews was\\nexcellent (Cohen\u2019s k=0.88).

The number (No.) of women included as cases and controls (or cohort) who were exposed and not exposed are\\nprovided (excluding from the table women who had exposure to talcum powder at less than the highest exposure). The study-specific odds\\nratios and 95% confidence interval are on the right side of the plot.\\n\\nuse of perineal talcum powder products and ovarian cancer was\\n1.47 (P<0.0001, 95% CI 1.31, 1.65) (Fig 2) and there was no\\nsignificant publication bias (Egger's test, P=0.94) (Fig 3). When\\nlimited to the case-control studies, the summary pooled odds\\nratio was 1.49 (P<0.0001, 95% CI 1.29, 1.72) (Supplementary\\nFigures 1 and 2), whereas the odds ratio for the cohort study was\\n1.40 (95% CI 1.17, 1.68). When excluding Wu et al.19 which\\ncombined perineal administration of talcum powder with other\\nmethods, the summary pooled odds ratio was 1.44 (95% CI\\n1.29, 1.60) (Supplementary Figure 3) and the studies remained\\nhomogenous (I2= 6.5%, P=0.382) without publication bias\\n(Egger\u2019s test, P=0.77) (Supplementary Figure 4).\\n\\nGiven the quality of a meta-analysis is dependent on the\\nquality of the studies it includes, we conducted a sensitivity\\nanalysis excluding the study with a NOS grade of 4 (Booth10).\\nThere was no meaningful change after excluding Booth, sum-\\nmary pooled odds ratio 1.48 (P<0.0001, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.69)\\n(Supplementary Figure 5) and the studies remained homogenous\\n(I2= 24.4%, P=0.22) without publication bias (Egger\u2019s test,\\nP=0.88) (Supplementary Figure 6).

The studies remained\\n\\nhomogenous (I2=39.3%, P=0.12) and did not have publication\\nbias (Egger\u2019s test, P=0.97) (Supplementary Figure 8).\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nWe found frequent use of perineal talcum powder is associated\\nwith an increased risk of ovarian cancer, with a pooled adjusted\\nodds ratio of 1.47 (95% CI 1.31, 1.65). The 11 contributing\\nstudies included in the review, including the longest published\\nfollow-up available from the Nurses\u2019 Health Study cohort, were\\nhomogenous, and the summary estimate was robust in the sensi-\\ntivity analysis. This meta-analysis makes a significant contribu-\\ntion to the available evidence as it is the first study that summa-\\nrizes the published cohort and case-control literature that focuses\\non frequent (multiple times per week) rather than ever use of talc.\\nThe precise mechanism whereby talcum powder causes\\novarian cancer is not fully understood. It is widely speculated\\nthat trans-genital migration of talc powder through the fallo-\\npian tubes to the ovaries and peritoneum results in inflamma-\\ntion and a cascade of changes that result in carcinogenesis.20,21\\nTalc fibers are found wit", "hin normal ovaries and within ovarian\\ncancer with \u201ccosmetic\u201d talc use22,23 supporting this theory. A\\ncase series by Steffen et al. reported 10 cases of patients with\\n\u201ccosmetic\u201d talc exposure and serous ovarian cancer evaluated\\nthe surgical specimens as well as cosmetic talcum powder\\n\\n\fJGIM\\n\\nWoolen et al.: Use of Frequent Perineal Talcum Powder and Ovarian Cancer\\n\\n2531\\n\\nFigure 3. Funnel plot for the risk of publication bias.\\n\\nmanufactured in the 1950s. The transmission electron micro-\\nscope tissue analysis and phase contrast microscopy found talc\\nin every serous ovarian cancer and anthophyllite asbestos in\\n80% (8/10) of the serous ovarian cancers, which matched the\\ntalcum-based powder from the 1950s. Asbestiform talc is\\nconsidered, along with asbestos, as a class 1 carcinogen for\\novarian cancer, by the International Agency for Research on\\nCancer.24 Thus, the strongest and most widely believed theory\\nis that asbestiform talc fibers and asbestos fibers are the\\netiological agents leading to the elevated cancer risk associated\\nwith their use.\\n\\nThe pooled odds ratio of 1.47 is higher than that of six\\nadditional systematic reviews which included case-control\\nstudies, all of which also report a statistically significant\\nassociation between talc and ovarian cancer (range of adjusted\\nodds ratios: 1.24\u20131.35).2\u20137 O\u2019Brien et al.1 concluded that\\nperineal talcum powder exposure in cohort studies was not\\nsignificantly associated with ovarian cancer. However, when\\nO\u2019Brien limited to women with patent fallopian tubes the\\nhazard was 1.13 (95% CI: 1.01 to 1.26) for ever versus never\\nuse and there was a dose response with increasing risk with\\nincreasing frequency of talcum powder use with a hazard ratio\\nof 1.40 (95% CI: 1.17 to 1.68) for daily users. The magnitude\\nof the higher association in our study compared to prior case-\\ncontrol and cohort meta-analyses was likely due to our focus\\non frequent rather than any talcum powder users, inclusion of\\nquality studies, and consistent definition of the exposure.\\n\\nOur meta-analysis included both case-control and cohort\\nobservational studies allowing use to include more cancer cases\\nthan cohort alone. Although there is the general belief that\\ncohort studies are better than case-control studies, both can\\nprovide accurate and meaningful information about statistical\\n\\nassociations. Since most publications on talc used a case-control\\ndesign with detailed quantification of the type and frequency of\\ntalc exposure missing from most of the cohort studies, it is\\nimportant to include the data from the case-control studies in\\nany summary estimate of the association with ovarian cancer.\\nWhile cohort studies can provide a superior design for some\\nresearch questions, the method provides less useful results when\\nquantification of the exposure is too crude to provide a mean-\\ningful estimation of exposure. Cohort studies for talcum powder\\ndid not define the type of powder exposure, consistently define\\nfrequency and duration, capture changes in exposure over time,\\nand relied on recall by participants for exposure which may\\ninvolve misclassification as would be expected in case control\\nstudies.25\u201327 Although it is well known that case-control study\\ndesign is susceptible to recall bias and misclassification, the bias\\nwas likely limited to participant recollection of their exposure\\nrather than influenced by the media, given there was no public-\\nity on the topic at the time of most publications: the first legal\\ncase was reported in the press in 2014 long after most studies\\ncompleted recruitment. The one study where patient recruitment\\noccurred after 2014 patients was Schildkraut et al.,17 where\\nrecruitment occurred between 2010 and 1015, and they adjusted\\nfor the additional bias.\\n\\nStrengths and Limitations\\n\\nThe primary strength of our study is our focus on frequent\\nusers of perineal talcum powder. Among women who report\\ntalcum powder use, the most common frequency is daily\\nuse,13 and this is the first systematic review to focus on\\nmultiple times per week users. The results were highly con-\\nsistent and homogenous, and the included studies were of high\\nquality. The work has limitations as well. We constructed our\\n\\n\f2532\\n\\nWoolen et al.: Use of Frequent Perineal Talcum Powder and Ovarian Cancer\\n\\nJGIM\\n\\nselection criteria prospectively to include studies with multiple\\ntimes per week and as close to daily talcum powder exposure\\nas possible. However, this meant that cohort and case-control\\nstudies that might have frequent-use patients were excluded if\\nthe questionnaire did not explicitly capture this information.\\nThe definition of talcum powder use varied by frequency and\\nduration between the case-control and cohort studies. Addi-\\ntionally, studies by Cook et al.12, Mills et al.15, Rosenblatt\\net al.16, and Schildkraut et al.17 were unable to differentiate\\nbetween use of perineal powders and the small subset using\\ncorns", "tarch (estimated at 1.5%). However, the differences in\\ndefinition and small inclusion of cornstarch likely did not\\naffect the results as there was no evidence for statistical het-\\nerogeneity in our study. The included studies were adjusted for\\nmultiple covariates. The possibility of additional confounders\\nto the studies likely exists.\\n\\nConclusions and Implications\\n\\nIn this analysis of pooled data from 10 case-control studies and\\na single cohort study, the frequent use of perineal talcum\\npowder use is associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer.\\nThese results support women avoiding the frequent use of\\ntalcum powder in the perineal area.\\n\\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supple-\\nmentary material available at https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-022-\\n07414-7.\\n\\nAcknowledgements: We thank Evans Whitaker, MD MLIS, for his\\nhelp in providing the literature review.\\nWe thank Katie O\u2019Brien, PhD, for her help in providing data from the\\nSIS and NHS1 studies.\\n\\nCorresponding Author: Sean A Woolen, MD MSc; Department of\\nRadiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California San\\nFrancisco, San Francisco, CA, USA (e-mail: sean.woolen@ucsf.edu).\\n\\nDeclarations:\\n\\nConflict of Interest: Sean Woolen: No relevant disclosures.\\nAnn A Lazar: No relevant disclosures.\\nRebecca Smith-Bindman: Served as a paid expert witness for the\\nplaintiffs in the talcum powder litigation.\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n\\n1.

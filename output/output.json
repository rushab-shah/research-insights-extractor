There was some indication in the cohort study of an increase in serous tumours. The evidence of talc migrating to the ovaries lends credibility to such a possible association.; The epidemiological evidence suggests that use of cosmetic talc in the perineal area may be associated with ovarian cancer risk.

The use of body powders should be assessed both in terms of calendar time and age of the subject.

Infertility and late age at menopause were associated with an increase in risk.; There was a significant trend of decreasing relative risk of ovarian cancer as the number of pregnancies increased for parous women (X2 (trend) = 3.9, P <0.05), and after adjusting for parity, the relative risks associated with successive numbers of incomplete pregnancies also decreased although the trend was not statistically significant (X2 (trend) = 0.5). Women having their first pregnancy after the age of 35 years had a significantly higher risk of ovarian cancer than women with a first pregnancy before the age of 20 years.; Increased risk of ovarian cancer associated with increasing duration of unprotected intercourse, especially in nulligravid women; Women who used oral contraceptives had a lower risk of ovarian cancer than those who had never used them, the risk being lowest in those who had first used oral contraceptives under the age of 25 years.; Women who reported hysterectomy, with or without unilateral\noophorectomy, had a much reduced risk (Table VIII). Total duration of ovulation was estimated as the months from menarche to diagnosis (cases) or interview (controls), or to menopause, whichever came first, minus the total months of anovulation due to pregnancy and oral contraceptive use. Women who reported a hysterectomy were excluded from these analyses as it was unknown if or when they had stopped ovulating. For all women combined, there was a strong trend of increasing risk the longer the duration of ovulation (X2 (trend) = 17.8, P <0.001) (Table IX).; Increased risk of ovarian cancer in nulligravid women, with risk decreasing as the number of pregnancies increase. Greater number of incomplete pregnancies decreases risk, although the trend was not significant. Infer- tility is a risk factor for ovarian cancer. Women who had not conceived but had been sexually active for more than 10 years without using contraception had about six times the risk of all other women. Some subfertility may also be associated with ovarian cancer.; Only Frances-\nchi et al.

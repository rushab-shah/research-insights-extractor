[{"name": "Risk factors for ovarian cancer a case-control study", "features": [{"name": "Conclusion", "value": "Women who have never had children (nulligravid) have a higher risk for ovarian cancer compared to women who have been pregnant (gravid), with the relative risk (RR) being 1.7 (95% CI 1.1-2.6). Among previous pregnancies, increasing number of pregnancies and higher parity is associated with a lower risk of ovarian cancer. Women having their first pregnancy after the age of 35 have a higher risk of ovarian cancer than women with a first pregnancy before the age of 20. Breastfeeding for more than two years in total is associated with over three times the risk of ovarian cancer compared to women who have never breastfed.; Risk of ovarian cancer increased with increasing duration of unprotected intercourse after adjustment for gravidity. Nulligravid women who reported more than 10 years of unprotected intercourse had a risk over six times that of nulligravid women who reported less than three months of unprotected intercourse.; Women who used oral contraceptives had a lower risk of ovarian cancer than those who had never used them, the risk being lowest in those who had first used oral contraceptives under the age of 25 years.; Women who reported hysterectomy, with or without unilateral oophorectomy, had a much reduced risk.; Most other studies have not investigated if women of low gravidity have an    increased risk of ovarian cancer because of reduced fertility. Our findings also suggest that infertility is a risk factor for ovarian cancer.; Increased risk of first pregnancy after 35 years (RR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.1-14.2), no association between contraception use and ovarian cancer, female sterilization and oral contraception associated with reduced risk of ovarian cancer, age at natural menopause strongly related to risk, no evidence that breast-feeding reduces risk of ovarian cancer; No overall relationship between hormone replacement therapy and ovarian cancer was found, although there was an increased risk among women who reported hysterectomy.; The text does not contain an explicit conclusion."}, {"name": "No. of Subjects", "value": "63 cases and 451 controls have been included in the analyses."}, {"name": "Relative Risk", "value": "Nulligravid women have a relative risk (RR) of 1.7 (95% CI 1.1-2.6) for ovarian cancer compared to gravid women.
